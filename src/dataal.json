In a video that a hiker shared, it was seen that the water flow from China's biggest continuous waterfall, Yuntai Mountain Waterfall, originated from a pipe that was positioned high up on the rock face. More than 70,000 people have liked the video since it was initially uploaded on Monday. According to the Yuntai tourism park operators, the \"small enhancement\" was done during the dry season to give guests a sense of purpose for their journey. The title of a video uploaded by user \"Farisvov\" says, \"The one about how I went through all the hardship to the source of Yuntai Waterfall only to see a pipe.\" On social media, the phrase \"the origin of Yuntai Waterfall is just some pipes\" started to gain popularity. After garnering over 14 million views on Weibo and almost 10 million views on Douyin, it created such a stir that local government representatives were dispatched to the park to look into it. According to state broadcaster CCTV, they instructed the operators to take a lesson from the tragedy and notify travelers in advance of the upgrades. The park later commented on behalf of the waterfall, stating, \"I didn't expect to meet everyone this way.\" \"As a seasonal scenery, I can't guarantee that I will be in my most beautiful form every time you come to see me,\" it says. \"I made a small enhancement during the dry season only so I would look my best to meet my friends.\" The 312-meter Yuntai Falls, located in central Henan province, are part of the Yuntai Mountain Geopark, a UNESCO Global Geopark. Every year, millions of people come to see geological structures that date back more than a billion years. Park authorities told CCTV that the water they used to pump into the falls was spring water and that it would not harm the natural scenery. Many internet users questioned how it could be referred to as the number one waterfall anymore. This is not the first time that artificial means have been utilized to \"help\" renowned waterfalls in China. Huangguoshu Waterfall, a popular tourist site in southern Guizhou province, has been aided by a water diversion project from a neighboring dam since 2006 to keep it flowing during the dry season.", "images": [{"url": "https://thefridaytimes.com/digital_images/medium/2024-06-09/fact-check-is-the-tallest-waterfall-in-china-fake-1717932067-3362.jpg", "path": "full/17592b1e2aaa869c0095e17a97aa388d6f807eef.jpg", "checksum": "114e238121b36d5fe74fc7eedc432a78", "status": "uptodate"}]},

A fact-check by showed that the reports were not fully accurate. On Thursday, former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa health minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Taimur Khan Jhagra posted a message on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that the interim provincial government had stopped the health insurance facility for the 40 million residents of the province. \"At a time of historic inflation, the health system should support the lower and middle classes and not kill them,\" he added while expressing his disappointment on the move. A check by found that the provincial government had imposed certain limits on the programme but did not suspend it. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Advisor on Health Dr Riaz Anwar held a news conference in Peshawar on Thursday where he announced certain changes the interim provincial government was bringing to the programme. He was accompanied by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Health Secretary Mahmood Aslam Wazir. \"We had two options: either we suspend the programme, which would ruin the poor, or we find a way to continue it,\" he said, adding that they chose to make the programme more effective and strengthen it. \"We opted to approve certain amendments in the programme, not end it,\" he said. He further explained that the changes to shorten the programme were being brought about because of the shrinking fiscal space after the annual expense on the programme increased from Rs30 billion annually to Rs39 billion. \"The provincial government still owes insurance companies around Rs17 billion,\" he said. However, he asserted that the caretaker provincial government had not made changes to the law. \"The Sehat card is still universal [application], but it has been linked with data of the Benazir Income Support Programme,\" stated the provincial health secretary Mahmood Aslam Wazir. He added that the caretaker government wanted to strengthen it and make the programme more effective. Noting that in no country of the world do the rich benefit from facilities created for the poor, Wazir said that they have now divided beneficiaries of the programme into five categories. In the first category, he said, those who earn less than Rs30,000 would be provided facilities. The second category includes those who earn Rs40,000 per month, and so on. The provincial health secretary added that this way, the rich will support the poor. \"It is our desire that we maintain quality while minimising complaints,\" he said. The official continued that under various laws, they will ensure the provision of at least ten beds in each hospital for cardholders. Moreover, he said that they are expanding the programme by including the best hospital in every district, even if that hospital is better by just a single percentage compared to covered hospitals. Meanwhile, Jhagra said that caretaker governments do not have the mandate to make major policy decisions and that the suspension of the Sehat Cards was a major policy change. He also contradicted a statement by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Caretaker Health Minister Riaz Anwar that the provincial government does not have the funds to manage the programme. \"Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's balances should now top over Rs50 billion,\" he wrote, adding, \"It's funny how the caretaker government could approve salary increments for bureaucrats worth Rs100 billion, including doubling the Secretariat allowances for secretariat employees. It's funny that they could approve Rs20 billion expenditure in a month on free atta (flour) for political purposes. But why should bureaucrats or unelected ministers worry about the 40 million people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa?\" Jhagra continued that a proposal to give free health insurance to people who earned less than Rs31,0000 per month was cleared in the same cabinet meeting where the minimum wage was increased to Rs32,000. When there is so much talk of investment, who will invest with a govt that only strikes contracts to go back on them, he said. In an accompanying video message, he suggested that Dr Anwar, too, could not fully justify the move. Jhagra continued that the programme has been shut down but then said that the programme has been limited to people entitled under the Benazir Income Support Programme. He added that this was an illegal move even though it crutched on some laws to give it a semblance of legality. \"If they have taken a policy decision of segmentation and taking co-payment from some people and limiting it, a caretaker government has no right to take a policy decision,\" he said, adding that this is established in past practices and Election Act 2017 and that it can be challenged in court and that his party will challenge it. Finally, the KP govt managed to stop the Sehat Card for 40 mln residents of KP. Some of the contradictions in the absurd, shocking and disappointing decision. At a time of historic inflation, the health system should support the lower and middle classes, and not kill them. a.…", "images": [{"url": "https://thefridaytimes.com/digital_images/medium/2023-09-08/fact-check-did-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-suspend-sehat-card-1694122212-2517.jpg", "path": "full/1515dded113ece4d854c0f2993a979825036c816.jpg", "checksum": "75fdc370668c5856ee8985022e91e6b5", "status": "uptodate"}]},

Due to security concerns, the provincial governments requested that six social media applications be suspended for about one week during Muharram. Faithful hold processions around the country during Muharram, while religious leaders address large crowds amid strict security, with hundreds of law enforcement officers deployed to safeguard security throughout the month.

The claim surfaced after journalist and anchorperson Gharidah Farooqi posted on the inaccessible social media platform 'X' (formerly known as Twitter) that the Syndicate of the University of Karachi had confirmed that Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri's degree was fake. She added that she had shared news about this a while ago with all relevant documents, but instead of believing her, a full bench of the IHC was assembled, which issued her notices on the matter. Farooqi said she had told the court she was sure about her story, but instead, she was \"harassed, penalised.\" Would those who had now been proven wrong apologise for misuse of their authority and compensate her? On Saturday, the Syndicate of the University of Karachi met at the university in Karachi. The varsity's Vice-Chancellor Dr Khalid Mahmood Iraqi chaired the Syndicate. The forum took up several matters relating to the university, including a request from the Higher Education Commission (HEC) to build the provincial higher education commission (SHEC) offices on varsity premises. The varsity's key decision-making body also reviewed inquiry reports against two faculty members and decided to remove them. The body also reviewed recommendations put forward by the varsity's Unfair Means Committee (UFMC). Per the official release of the university, the varsity, after reviewing the recommendations of the UFMC, approved them, \"which proposed a cancellation of the degree and enrollment cards of the candidate(s) who were found in unethical and immoral acts.\" Per sources inside the University of Karachi, the UFMC is the relevant section within the varsity which reviews matters of fake degrees or enrollments related to the varsity. Regarding Justice Jahangiri's degree, the source shared that the UFMC had presented a well-investigated and documented case indicating that the candidate had participated in acts during their studies and official processes that were contrary to the university's established policy. Moreover, the university could not confirm other relevant educational records pertaining to the candidate. The source further confided that the UFMC's recommendations regarding the candidate had been pending before the Syndicate for a while before being approved on Saturday. Meanwhile, journalist Naimat Khan on X that Dr Hasaan Auj, a member of the varsity's Syndicate, had confirmed that Justice Jahangiri's degree was among the issues discussed during Saturday's Syndicate meeting and that the body had approved the UFMC's recommendations. There was a controversy regarding the Syndicate meeting concerning one of its members, Dr Riaz Ahmed. Per his wife's claims, he had apparently gone to the Bahadurabad police station. While his car had been pictured outside the station, he did not emerge for several hours. Later, he and his car left the station, escorted by a police van. He, however, could not be traced after that, sparking fears that he had been allegedly detained at an unidentified location. But the police claimed he was never at the station and were unaware of his whereabouts. Dr Ahmed, however, later returned, but the mystery surrounding his disappearance remains. Justice Jahangiri is a native of the Mansehra district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and had become a member of the Islamabad Bar Association in 1992 and had enrolled as an advocate of the high court in 1994. He became an advocate of the Supreme Court in 2008. An accomplished lawyer, he was elected as the president of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association for the year 2016-17, while he had previously served as the president of the Islamabad District Bar Association from 2005-6. He had also served on prestigious government positions as well, including as the Advocate General for the Islamabad Capital Territory on the Supreme Court and the Islamabad High Court in 2018-19. Prior to that, he had served as the deputy prosecutor general in the National Accountability Bureau for the Rawalpindi / Islamabad region for the year 2009-10. Before being elevated as a judge of the Islamabad High Court on December 30, 2020, he had taught criminal law at the Quaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad. With regards to his academic qualifications, Justice Jahangiri's profile on the Islamabad High Court's lists it as having studied at the Gordon College Rawalpindi and then at the Federal Government Post Graduate College in Sector H-8, Islamabad. He then secured his law degree from the University of Karachi.", "images": [{"url": "https://thefridaytimes.com/digital_images/medium/2024-09-02/are-justice-tariq-jahangiri-s-degrees-fake-1725274611-1562.png", "path": "full/e5301d6a0837b163a6503fc05ae25fd510a764bc.jpg", "checksum": "a37d266b1b6df945ca6dad2088cc4d27", "status": "uptodate"}]},

A Foreign Office spokesperson emphasized, “The disrespect of host country’s national anthem is against diplomatic norms. This act of Acting Consul General of Afghanistan is reprehensible. We are conveying our strong protest to the Afghan authorities both in Islamabad and Kabul.” On the other hand, the Afghan Consulate in Peshawar attempted to defend the actions of its Acting Consul General, Hafiz Mohibullah Shakir, claiming that the decision not to stand was due to the presence of music in the anthem. In an official statement, the spokesperson said, “There was no intention to disrespect or demean Pakistan’s national anthem.

Trump made this statement earlier this week while speaking at a campaign event in Houston, Texas, a city with a sizable Pakistani diaspora. Many PTI followers in Houston favour Trump because they believe that the Biden government is antagonistic to Imran Khan. Soleimani was a key figure in Iran, directing the Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force and playing an important role in Iran's Middle Eastern influence. On January 3, 2020, he was slain by a US drone attack near Baghdad International Airport, only days before Trump departed the White House for the 46th president, Joe Biden. Trump plans to run for reelection in 2024. Trump recalled discussing Soleimani's assassination with Imran Khan, saying, \"They had a Pakistan Khan; he was a great cricket player, and he became the head of Pakistan.\" He described it as \"the biggest moment of my (Imran's) life.\" He stated that the then-prime minister also informed him, \"When I heard that Soleimani had been killed, I left my office.\" I walked to my house. It was the biggest event that ever happened to me.” Trump then began introducing Khan to his predominantly white American audience, saying, \"He was the greatest cricket player.\" That's equivalent to being a great NFL or baseball player in America. He was thought to be the best-looking person around. He became the boss, Pakistan.\" Trump elaborated on his meeting with Imran, claiming that the former Pakistani prime minister told him, \"I left, and I contemplated for one week.\" It was the most important event of my life. That has never happened to me before.\" \"Many people felt that way,\" Trump added. He did not, however, specify when or where he had this chat with Imran Khan. Moreover, there is also no record of the two presidents speaking on the phone about Soleimani's killing. The now-incarcerated PTI leader visited Washington from July 21 to July 23, 2019. He visited New York in September 2019 to address the UN General Assembly and met with Trump on September 23. Soleimani had not yet been assassinated when the two met. Trump's assertion that Khan went into seclusion after Soleimani's killing is also contested since Khan spoke at a rally in Mianwali the day after the tragedy and did not reference Soleimani's assassination. Furthermore, the claim that Khan went from his office to his residence looks to be false, as his office was around 15 kilometers from his home, and as a prime minister, he could not have gone 15 kilometers alone without being seen.", "images": [{"url": "https://thefridaytimes.com/digital_images/medium/2023-11-09/fact-check-did-imran-khan-isolate-after-hearing-of-qassem-soleimani-s-assassination-1699526598-2123.jpg", "path": "full/4a0399fd956b1e77dfd1a8dda9bd3a3c9d109593.jpg", "checksum": "0fda5ba1e8bba8193028b7055ccca330", "status": "uptodate"}]},

The police have denied Dasti's claims. In a video posted on the social media platform ‘X’, formerly known as Twitter, Dasti claimed that LEAs personnel stormed his house, forcibly stripped his wife, and manhandled his children. In the video, the PTI leader appealed directly to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Justice Qazi Faiz Isa, regretting the ‘loss of his honor’ and expressing a willingness to face any consequence, even death. However, Dasti has failed to provide any evidence to prove his allegations, which has raised several questions about the authenticity of his accusations. Many analysts believe that the video is part of the propaganda campaign the PTI is pursuing to build a narrative of victimisation. It is pertinent to mention here that Dasti has been booked in several cases with Muzaffargarh's Saddar police and has evaded multiple attempts at being arrested. Meanwhile, Muzaffargarh's Station House Officer (SHO), Khurram Riaz, rebuffed Dasti's accusations in a video statement, terming them as \"baseless\" and “fabricated.\" The SHO said that Dasti's video was aimed at instigating \"fear and disorder\" amongst his community. According to SHO, a police squad searched the neighborhood and got information from the public, and no one raided Dasti's residence. The SHO also stated that his wife visited the RO office two days ago but did not register a report regarding a threat or harassment.", "images": [{"url": "https://thefridaytimes.com/digital_images/medium/2024-01-02/fact-check-did-leas-strip-jamshed-dasti-s-wife-naked-during-raid-1704190056-1727.jpg", "path": "full/30e324b6467dd006fd1072ff193f1b2a0be556d7.jpg", "checksum": "11829f7ca77ae5b16710cddeef07af66", "status": "uptodate"}]},

However, many were quick to point out that the individual mentioned was not a party ticket holder. looked into the claims to do a fact check on whether this was true or not. The PML-N on Sunday claimed that Mehar Muhammad Waseem, a PTI ticket holder for the National Assembly constituency NA-119, had decided to withdraw after meeting with Maryam Nawaz and that union council chairmen, vice chairmen, Zakat Committee chairmen and other party office holders had decided to join the PML-N and will formally announce the change in party affiliation in the January 25 rally. لاہور:21 جنوری قومی اسمبلی کے لاہور سے حلقہ این اے 119 میں مسلم لیگ (ن) کے لئے بڑا بریک تھرو پی ٹی آئی کے قومی اور صوبائی اسمبلی کے امیدوار اورحامی مسلم لیگ (ن) کے حق میں دستبردار پی ٹی آئی کے ٹکٹ ہولڈر مہر محمد وسیم اپنے ہزاروں کارکنوں سمیت مسلم لیگ (ن) میں شامل مہر محمد… When cross-checked the claims, it was discovered that the PTI did not award any ticket to a \"Mehar Muhammad Waseem\". In the list of tickets issued for the Punjab Assembly (PP), the PTI had two awardees from Lahore named 'Mehar'. The first was a 'Mehar Sharafat' from PP-158 Lahore-XV. The second was 'Mehar Wajid' from PP-171 Lahore-XXVIII. In the list of tickets for the National Assembly, the party listed a Khawaja Shahzad Farooq for NA-119 - the brother of Mian Abid Farooq — wanted for his alleged involvement in May 9 incidents; Maryam is also a candidate in this constituency. Elsewhere, a 'Mehar Khalid' was awarded a ticket for NA-94 Chiniot-II and a 'Mehar Bano Qureshi' from NA-151 Multan-IV, a 'Mehar Sajjad Cheena' from NA-186 DG Khan-III. In fact, of the 19 candidates in Maryam Nawaz's constituency of NA-119, the list of candidates published by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) does not carry the name \"Mehar Muhammad Waseem\" or even a \"Muhammad Waseem\". In the 14 national assembly constituencies of Lahore, no \"Mehar Muhammad Waseem\" was listed as contesting the elections (whether on a party ticket or as an independent). In the 30 provincial assembly seats, Muhammad Waseem Amir Malik was listed as an independent candidate from PP-146 Lahore-II. From PP-159 Lahore-XV, an independent candidate named \"Mehar Sharafat Ali\" was listed by the ECP as a candidate. Maryam Nawaz is a contestant for the provincial assembly from the same constituency. In PP-166 Lahore-XXII, an independent candidate named \"Waseem Amin\" has been listed. Similarly, in PP-167 Lahore-XXIII, independent candidate \"Waseem Munir\" has been listed. The PML-N has awarded a ticket to a \"Mehar Isthiaq Ahmad Anwar\" from PP-171 Lahore-XXVII. Some claimed that Mehar Muhammad Waseem was a candidate in the 2018 elections. مہر وسیم تحریک انصاف کے 2018 الیکشن کے ٹکٹ ہولڈر تھے، اس حلقے پر پارٹی ٹکٹ کا مسئلہ تھا اور پارٹی نے دو دن پہلے تک ٹکٹ pending رکھا، ٹکٹ نہ ملنے پر اج مہر وسیم ن لیگ میں شامل ہوگئے In the 2018 elections, there was no candidate from Lahore with the name \"Mehar Muhammad Waseem\" in the national assembly. In the provincial assembly, a \"Mehar Imran\" was listed as a candidate from PP-152 Lahore-IX, who contested as an independent and secured just 126 votes. No candidate named Mehar Muhammad Waseem is listed either as a contesting candidate by any party or as an independent for the upcoming elections. Moreover, for those who claimed such an individual was a ticket holder in the 2018 general elections, no evidence is found either. There is, however, a Mehar Sharafat whose name appears in the PTI lists as well as in the ECP lists. This story requires greater clarification on who the individual mentioned is.

The Parks and Horticulture Authority in Sargodha organized a folk festival from December 7 to 13, in which Punjabi folk singer Muhammad Ashraf Malik, popularly known as Malkoo, also participated. Malkoo sang various songs at the folk fair, but during this time he also sang a song written for former Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan titled 'Qaeedi # 804' (prisoner number 804).

Nawaz was contesting the seat against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) backed Shehzada Muhammad Gushtap Khan. According to Form 47 (sheet of final consolidated results) for NA-15 issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on their official , Nawaz bagged 80,382 votes. By comparison, Gushtap Khan secured 105,249 votes and won the seat. Mufti Kifayatullah of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) was third after securing 29,931 votes. However, the PML-N posted an image of a signed copy of Form 47 from the designated Returning Officer, Additional Deputy Commissioner Hajira Sami, in which Nawaz Sharif was shown to have received 123,070 votes. Gushtap had received 87,600 votes. Both forms said 247,600 votes had been cast, including 140,288 by men and 107,312 by women. Of these, 9,082 votes were excluded from the final count because they were incorrectly cast. This left the final count of total votes at 238,518 and a turnout of 38.38%. A tally of the votes received by each candidate mentioned on Form 47 released by the ECP tallied with the final count mentioned at the top of the form. For the image of Form 47 released by the PML-N, the tally reached 263,557 votes, some 15,957 more than the votes polled in the constituency. A forensic analysis of the images showed that while the ECP released a PDF of the image of Form 47, it appeared to be a proper scan with clear numbers, even if the names were not as crisp as the numbers due to the difference in font, the ECP document could be zoomed in several hundred times for a clearer look at each row of results. A false colour Error Level Analysis of a full-sized screenshot (saved as a lossless PNG) taken of ECP's Form 47 also showed that the result sheet was fairly consistent in all the ink on printed paper and a clear stamp with clear dates and signatures. By comparison, the image of Form 47 shared by the PML-N was quite poor in quality. Zooming into the image showed that it quickly became illegible. It also seemed to carry some speculars of light, as if shot from behind a reflective surface like a glass pane with a mobile phone flash. We also see a signature of the suspected mobile device with which the original image could have been taken. A false colour Error Level Analysis of the original image shared by PML-N via their official account on social media platform 'X' (formerly known as Twitter) showed that there were artifacts in the image, which was saved at 75% JPEG quality. However, the artifacts did not just appear where the two specific results were. What is curious to note is that in the result sheet issued by the PML-N, Nawaz's vote tally is shown as 123,070. The result immediately below Nawaz's, of independent candidate Muhammad Haroon, is listed as 3,070. The way \"3,070\" appears in Nawaz's result is very similar to the \"3,070\" for Haroon but has a slightly larger clearing from the cell separator line below it. The \"12\" of 123,070 also appear to have an inconsistent gap between them. If we examine Gashtap's vote tally, we again see inconsistency in the gaps between the number and the table cell walls. In fact, they are more pronounced here than when compared to Nawaz's result. The numbers, too, appear inconsistent, with the \"8\" of \"87,600\" appearing to be cut from the top while the top of 7 is far sharper and thicker. In fact, if you scroll to where the total votes cast in the constituency are listed: \"247,600\" and examine it closely, you will find the \"7\" here consistent with the \"7\" where Gashtap's vote tally has been listed. The image shared by PML-N is suspect by virtue of several factors: 1. The vote tallies do not match 2. The image quality is far too poor 3. Digital artifacts on the image 4. Suspect and inconsistent numbers Both sides need to offer a greater explanation for the source of their results to definitively put this argument to rest.

Reports were circulating on social media that the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CCPA-G) has proposed imposing a tax of Rs2,000 per kilowatt on both residential and commercial solar panel users. The minister chose to respond on the X (a platform that his government has kept blocked since taking power). In his post, Asif said that no summary has been initiated by the CCPA-G or by the Power Division. He further mentioned that imposing a tax on any product is not even the mandate of the CPPA-G. Only the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has authority to do so, he stated. Asif said that the net metering regime, as practiced these days, unduly punishes non-participant poorer families. Therefore, it is being reviewed to ensure that existing net-metered consumers (roughly 1.75 lacs) remain protected, he added. No further burden is shifted to those consumers (roughly 25 million) who are not net-metered; the current additional burden for such consumers is Rs 110 billion per annum, he stated. The minister also urged social media users to kindly check the facts before sharing anything related to public importance on social media. It is pertinent to mention here that the cost of solar systems ranging from 7 to 15 kilowatts has significantly decreased in local markets.", "images": [{"url": "https://thefridaytimes.com/digital_images/medium/2024-04-30/fact-check-is-govt-considering-taxes-for-solar-panel-users-1714481448-3507.jpg", "path": "full/5ff2e2717293d2f78a921d050a84e021d709e2f3.jpg", "checksum": "adfdb7a9e70f1c21d7c05169e1cd2643", "status": "uptodate"}]},

The announcement caused quite a stir on social media. But when details of the proposition came to light, it raised questions about the initial reports that the provincial government was purchasing the aircraft. The whole thing started when local news channels aired reports that Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif was planning to buy a new jet for the Punjab government. These news reports were soon followed up by social media posts by provincial minister Azma Bukhari, in which she shared photos of a plane. Later, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)  leader and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif shared a video in which you could see Rescue 1122 staff carrying out an exercise using the plane. While government officials publicly announced the planes' imminent arrival and explained how they would operate, it is important to unpack what has actually happened. An air ambulance is simply an aircraft, such as a helicopter or fixed-wing aeroplane, that has been retrofitted to transport injured or ill people in a medical emergency over a distance or area impractical for a conventional ground ambulance. Like ground ambulances, air ambulances are also equipped with medical equipment necessary to monitor and treat injured or ill patients. Medical equipment in air ambulances includes medications, ventilators, electrocardiogram (ECG) and monitoring units, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) equipment, and stretchers. There are two types of air ambulances. The first type is equipped with medical personnel who can provide in-flight medical care. The other type is non-medically equipped and crewed aircraft that can easily transport critically ill patients who do not require in-flight health maintenance. In military parlance, the first type of air ambulance is referred to as a medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) and the latter is called casualty evacuation (CASEVAC). First, let's see what the Punjab government has said about the air ambulances. According to a tender issued by the Punjab government's Emergency Services Agency Rescue 1122 on March 10, 2024, the Punjab government said it was launching an \"Air Ambulance Service in Punjab\" to transport critical patients from remote areas in south and north Punjab to specialised hospitals. For this purpose, one air ambulance will be stationed at Rawalpindi/Mianwali and the other at Multan/Bahawalnagar. The tender invited companies that were prequalified/registered with the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) to submit their tenders/ bids for providing two aircraft for a year— the duration of which could be extended based on their performance as per the Punjab Procurement Rules 2014. The Punjab government and the PML-N social media groups complicated the whole narrative. It appeared that Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was talking about one thing while her public relations team was talking about another, and the whole social media troupe was on a different tangent. The corrigendum evidences that the rescue organisations and civil aviation authorities were probably watching from the sidelines before they decided to intervene and correct course. In the corrigendum the government of Punjab corrected that \"Reference to tender notice No.15/23-24(Dev) published under IPL No.2007 in the newspapers namely \" \", \" \" and \" \" on March 10, 2024, to launch the Air Ambulance Service in Punjab. Accordingly, the description for \"two airplanes for provision of Alr Ambulance Service in Punjab is hereby replaced with the description of \"Hiring of Services for Alr Ambulance Service in Punjab\". What the change in the tender essentially translates to is the difference between the Punjab government buying and maintaining these aircraft at their expense—and watching them turn into white elephants in their backyard, akin to the Pakistan International Airlines for the federal government—as opposed to renting these aircraft from someone who owns and maintains them. While the Punjab government tacitly acknowledged it was not buying the planes but rather acquiring services that, in effect, would allow Punjab to access two planes to cater to emergencies across the province, PML-N's social media troupe and public relations machine, led by Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari, decided to push ahead with the narrative that \"Maryam Nawaz is buying two air ambulances.\" In a press conference, Bukhari maintained that \"Maryam Nawaz has bought this plane for the convenience of the people.\" This statement, however, is a misrepresentation. Either the Punjab government (Maryam Nawaz Sharif is the Chief Minister) is buying planes for rescue services, or, according to the tender advertisement for rescue services, the Punjab government needs \"service\" providers for the Air Ambulance Service, not planes. Moreover, the Punjab government spokesperson made the following claims: Bukhari followed up the press conference on April 13 with a tweet in which she shared four pictures of a plane and wrote, \"This is the plane that the Chief Minister of Punjab has bought for the patients.\" https://x.com/AzmaBokhariPMLN/status/1779122322110136353 However, according to the tenders from the Punjab government, neither the Punjab chief minister nor the Punjab government has bought the plane; it is being bought (or is already owned) by the service provider. Of further interest are the images of the plane shared by Bukhari. They show a plane with seats for four passengers parked in front of the Lansaria Aircraft Interiors hangar at an airstrip outside of Johannesburg, South Africa. It is a Piper Seneca II aircraft built by American aircraft manufacturer Piper in 1975. The aircraft's registration shows that Heritage Aviation of South Africa currently owns it, with the registration number \"ZS-PPV.\" However, this aircraft has yet to reach Pakistan and register with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Bukhari's proclamations were followed by a video shared by Maryam Nawaz Sharif and then repeated on PML-N accounts. This video showed Rescue 1122 personnel conducting a drill where they transport patients on a plane. However, the aircraft shown in this video carries the registration number \"AP-BPA\". SkyWings Aviation acquired it in November 2018. SkyWings Aviation is a Karachi-based company and trustee of the Abdul Sattar Edhi Foundation, which operated the first air ambulance in the country. It holds an Aerial Work License Class-I (domestic) issued by the PCAA and is valid until October 27, 2024. In addition, SkyWings has a Class-II flying school licence, valid until November 13, 2028. Last year, Skywings announced an air taxi, but it got a weaker-than-expected response and is currently not being operated. Skywings currently operates an air ambulance service for the Edhi Foundation. The aircraft \"AP-BPA\" was imported on January 25, 2021 and was registered in Pakistan in February 2024. This aircraft could have been used as an air ambulance from 2018 onwards. Thus, the plane seen in Maryam Nawaz Sharif's video is the same plane operated by SkyWings for Edhi. Thus, we are now in a better position to understand the context and reality of the information shared by Punjab Information Minister and spokesperson Azma Bukhari in her press conference and subsequent tweets. 1. The first Air Ambulance aircraft has reached Pakistan. Not a single plane has reached Pakistan yet, nor have they been registered with Pakistani authorities, the CAA. One aircraft to be acquired by SkyWings is still in South Africa, while the other is still in the US. If everything goes according to plan, the plane in South Africa is expected to reach Pakistan by the end of May or early June, while the plane in the US is expected to reach Pakistan in June. 2. The air ambulance can land in a small space. This statement depends on many factors including the aircraft, the place of landing and the pilot. There are various places in Pakistan where aircraft can land or take off from certain segments of the highways or motorways. The aircraft that SkyWings is acquiring can land at many places across the country if the place has been inspected on the ground and is deemed safe for landing. Apart from highways, this aircraft can also land on paved surfaces and grassy fields. Punjab has eight major airports and around a dozen airstrips that can be used in emergency situations, such as the airstrip near Sahiwal or Okara Cantt or the emergency strip at the stone crushing area in Sargodha, which is connected to the road. An airbase or an army base can be the exception. However, all this will depend on the operator's ability to execute the process securely and their willingness to take risks. The Punjab government has shortlisted three operators for the Air Ambulance Service Charter. These include Lahore's Hybrid Aviation and two companies from Karachi, including SkyWings Aviation and Aircraft Sales and Services Corporation. According to the Rescue 1122 department, the Punjab government will evaluate the bids submitted by these companies and select the firm with the lowest evaluated bid. SkyWings Aviation submitted the lowest bid to operate two air ambulances at a cost of only Rs180,000 (US$540) per hour, including all repairs, maintenance, fuel, staff salary, insurance, etc. The firm has thus been awarded the contract. According to the rescue agency, the estimated cost approved by the Punjab government for this contract is Rs440 million. Such a budget indicates that the provincial government is not looking at operating a large number of flights. Even if the entire budget is allocated to operating flights, it would allow for around seven to ten flights per month. These could change based on any change in the rupee-dollar exchange rate. The company says the air ambulance can carry two pilots, one patient, one paramedic and one attendant. Moreover, the plane will be able to land on smooth surfaces such as motorways and local roads with short landings and takeoffs. Maryam and the rescue organisation had said that the air ambulances would be stationed in northern and southern Punjab, with one plane available in Rawalpindi and the other in Multan. The Chief Minister's helicopter will be available in Lahore. Azma Bukhari further said that space will be created for landing planes and helicopters in hospitals. The expediency of the service will be determined based on how it performs, but as it stands, the claims made by certain members of the Punjab government are inaccurate. The province has outsourced the operation of two fixed-wing aircraft as air ambulances in the province's north, western, and southern areas. But, these aircraft have yet to arrive in Pakistan, and the service is not expected to become fully operational until later this year.", "images": [{"url": "https://thefridaytimes.com/digital_images/medium/2024-04-25/did-the-punjab-govt-buy-2-air-ambulances-1713985785-1936.jpeg", "path": "full/0929fa9b2bcd8c55c914585ca559273ba5e1faa0.jpg", "checksum": "23f1ee957b464b043527f96e224e53a8", "status": "uptodate"}]},

In fact, Jamal belongs to the famous Raisani family of Balochistan, and his father was assassinated during an attack by a banned outfit while he was engaged in an election campaign. It is yet to be ascertained whether Jamal Raisani will succeed in proving his expertise and skills in the field of politics or not, but he has no blood relation to PM Kakar. It is pertinent to mention here that Kakar is a Pashtun tribe in Balochistan, whereas Raisani is a Baloch tribe.", "images": [{"url": "https://thefridaytimes.com/digital_images/medium/2023-09-04/fact-check-balochistan-sports-minister-jamal-raisani-is-not-son-of-interim-pm-kakar-1693809935-5618.jpg", "path": "full/d6e94023cf186a7ce328e3f7e486c2f95559a9a7.jpg", "checksum": "9d753794073ce6e2bce44361569b5c24", "status": "uptodate"}]},

While shared by several people on social media, including some journalists, as \"breaking news\", the post went viral as nationwide protests struck Pakistan on the weekend against inflation and a hike in power bills. It raised concerns about whether the notification from Afghanistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs was real or issued recently. The Friday Times investigated the reports. The notification, a picture of which was being shared, contained the crest of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (the official name of Afghanistan under the Afghan Taliban's interim government). The text of the notification, which is in English rather than Afghanistan's native Dari, read: \"IEA-MoFA statement concerning developments in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is saddened by the recent events in Pakistan, leading to large-scale protests and even violence in some instances. The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan considers political stability in Pakistan in the interest of the Muslim people of Pakistan and the broader region and hopes the sides demonstrate restraint and understanding. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has given necessary instructions to our offices in Pakistan with regards to the protection of Afghan nationals residing in Pakistan during these developments.\" The notification that was being spread did appear genuine. However, some incidents mentioned in the notification did not reflect incidents in Pakistan over the past week. In particular, the notification referred to \"large-scale protests and even violence in some instances\". Further, it pointed to the lack of political stability in Pakistan. It expressed hope that different sides would demonstrate \"restraint and understanding\". While there have been protests and some violence in the form of protesters burning their power bills and pelting the offices of power distribution companies with stones, while in some areas, workers of power companies were manhandled, there were no large-scale concerted protests nor heavy violence. Further on political instability, the country is currently under a caretaker setup as per the Constitution after the term of the assemblies ended. An attempt to trace the notification on the official channels of the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs showed that no such notification had been posted on either the website of the ministry or on any of its social media accounts in recent weeks. However, the notification continued to be shared by people on social media during this period. Advanced means to trace the notification led to the original notification. The original notification, which is identical in appearance and content to the one circulating on social media, is dated May 10, 2023, and was issued in the aftermath of the protests and violence witnessed on May 9. IEA-MoFA statement concerning developments in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan Large-scale protests accompanied by violence were witnessed on May 9 in the aftermath of former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan's brief arrest in Islamabad. Widespread arrests of PTI officials and workers followed the violence. The party claims around 10,000 people were arrested. Thus, the posts circulating are misleading as a notification from an older date is being used out of its proper context.", "images": [{"url": "https://thefridaytimes.com/digital_images/medium/2023-09-03/fact-check-did-afghanistan-advise-its-citizens-against-travelling-to-pakistan-due-to-instability-the-1693757981-4137.png", "path": "full/a1bc9caf1592f11d56de7507d7584d2de8cf398b.jpg", "checksum": "7a86f62ac09f67f5fc9c464f68f56605", "status": "uptodate"}]},

A fact-check by found that while the reports were true, there was important context missing. On Friday evening, reports emerged on television channels that Judge Dilawar, who adjudged that Imran had misdeclared his assets before the Election Commission of Pakistan for failing to disclose income from selling gifts retained from the Toshakhana, had been reassigned as Officer on Special Duty (OSD). This post within each department carries no real designation or tasks. It effectively means the officer such designated has been suspended from duty. However, some journalists later claimed, citing sources, that Judge Dilawar had written to the Islamabad High Court Registrar citing security threats. The letter later emerged on the media that confirmed this to be the case. In his letter, Judge Dilawar sought a transfer. He refers to his judgement against Imran Khan in the Toshakhana case, adding that a campaign was launched against him during the trial, which gained steam after he issued a verdict. \"During the trial and particularly after passing the judgement, a campaign on social media was launched against the undersigned, leading to serious threats from different people across the world,\" he wrote, adding, \"Even my family in my native town received threats from beyond the border.\" Dilating on the threats and their impact on his family, Judge Dilawar noted that his children were facing hardship in moving to school and facing an unpleasant situation. \"An organized social media campaign was orchestrated against the undersigned and family,\" he wrote. Judge Dilawar, who embarked on an official trip to the UK immediately after issuing the verdict in the Toshakhana case to attend a workshop on law and jurisprudence at the University of Hull in the UK on the nomination of the superior courts in Pakistan, was subjected to protests by overseas Pakistanis residing in the UK. Several protesters staged a demonstration on the campus where Judge Dilawar was attending the workshop along with other judges. Judge Dilawar mentioned this in his letter to the IHC registrar: \"During a recent visit of the undersigned to the UK to attend training at the University of Hull, the undersigned and other judicial officers had to undergo displeasing episodes,\" he noted. He goes on to request a transfer from the civil courts to \"preferably in special courts located in the Judicial Complex G-11 or Honourable Islamabad High Court,\" the letter concludes. The news reports that Judge Dilawar had been transferred out of the civil courts and made 'OSD' were true. A notification was issued by the IHC Additional (Establishment) Registrar Ijaz Ahmed late on Friday said that Additional District and Sessions Judge Dilawar - a basic pay scale (BPS) grade 20 officer - had been transferred from his current posting in the civil courts of Islamabad West to Officer on Special Duty (OSD) in the IHC. It added that the judicial officer, Judge Dilawar, \"shall join his new assignment with immediate effect\". Usually this means a suspension. However, in this case, Judge Dilawar was transferred against a \"newly created post\" in the IHC, meaning he has been transferred and is likely to receive a new assignment in the coming days. Earlier on Friday, Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Aamer Farooq, while hearing pleas from PTI representatives against the trial court's verdict, noted flaws in Judge Dilawar's judgement and seemed to question how the case was conducted and the verdict arrived at.", "images": [{"url": "https://thefridaytimes.com/digital_images/medium/2023-08-26/fact-check-was-judge-humayun-dilawar-suspended-1692993557-4137.png", "path": "full/1297cf5f704e500a1ada2ea0dd9ef4bbcd86f4f6.jpg", "checksum": "3d85309e502029d0eac6220026caa8e9", "status": "uptodate"}]},
