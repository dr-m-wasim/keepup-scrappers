Several anomalies in the image further suggest it was not a genuine photo. For example, Donald Trump's left hand exhibits unnatural distortions, including an abnormally large thumb. While Richard Grenell's right hand has multiple fingers, with three pairs of fingers visible and a missing thumb. Additionally, no reputable media outlet has reported on an actual photo of Trump and Grenell holding a Free Imran Khan banner. This supports the claim that the image is fabricated.

In a recent television interview, Sajjad Mustafa Syed, chairman of the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA), claimed that many developed countries follow this practice, citing examples such as the European Union (EU), India, United States (US), Philippines, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Ireland. The claim is misleading. Experts confirm that such a policy is not common in democratic nations, with India being an exception. On December 5, during an appearance on a private television channel, Syed proposed that the Pakistani government follow the example of countries like the US, EU, and India in requiring VPN providers to set up operations locally. He argued this would address national security concerns related to online activities. Syed said: \"We have two global paths to follow. One is the path followed by North Korea, Iran, and Turkmenistan. The other is the path being followed by the US, India, Philippines. We are suggesting [to the government] that the countries we trade with like EU or US or the countries we compete with like India, Bangladesh, Philippines, Vietnam, and Ireland. We should follow their methodology. The method is that rather than whitelisting VPNs, you reverse it. Get VPN service providers to set up their businesses in Pakistan. Then you get them to monitor [users]” and have them implement your national security concerns. Watch the interview at 29:00. The claim that requiring VPN providers to register locally and share user data is a standard practice in democratic countries is misleading and mostly untrue. In reality, such policies are not common in democratic nations, except in India, where it is highly controversial. Christian Dawson, co-founder and executive director of the US-based Internet Infrastructure Coalition (i2Coalition), explained to that most democratic countries do not require VPN providers to register locally or monitor user data systematically. Dawson provided a breakdown of the regulatory landscape in the countries mentioned by Syed: European Union (EU): There is no unified requirement across EU member states for VPN providers to register locally or routinely share user data with governments. On the contrary, strict privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), limit data sharing, including with authorities, unless specific legal conditions are met. United States: There is no federal mandate requiring VPN providers to register or share user data systematically. However, providers can be subject to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or warrants, under frameworks like the Patriot Act or the CLOUD Act. The Philippines, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Ireland: The regulatory landscape varies significantly. For example, Vietnam enforces strict data localisation laws that indirectly impact VPN operations, while other countries may require compliance with cybersecurity frameworks that could include limited government access to data. However, India stands out as an exception. India's recent laws require VPN providers to maintain logs and share them with the government upon request. This move has been met with resistance and sparked privacy concerns, causing many premium VPN providers to exit the Indian market. Dawson added, “It’s worth noting that many non-democratic countries, such as Myanmar and China, impose strict VPN registration and monitoring as a tool for control and surveillance. This highlights the significant contrast with most democracies, which generally prioritise personal freedoms and privacy rights.” This was corroborated by Shruti Narayan, the Asia Pacific Policy Counsel for Access Now, a US-based digital rights group, confirmed that India is the only country on Syed's list where VPN providers are legally required to store user data and hand it over to authorities if needed. Narayan also pointed out that this move has been criticised as a violation of privacy rights protected by India's constitution. In June 2022, Access Now released a press statement calling the Indian government’s decision a violation of the right to privacy which the Indian constitution protected. The statement can be read . Narayan further said that such measures are not in line with democratic values. “Mandating registration, monitoring, and data collection and sharing as a rule is not compliant with the principles of privacy and free speech in a democracy. We believe that VPN registration does not serve legitimate security interests, and is done to enable surveillance and authoritarian control,” she added. The suggestion that many developed countries require VPN providers to register locally and share user data is largely misleading. While India has adopted such a policy, it has faced widespread criticism for infringing on privacy rights. In contrast, most democratic nations prioritise personal freedoms and privacy and do not mandate VPN registration or data sharing.", "images": [{"url": "https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2024-12-24/l_581302_090132_updates.jpg", "path": "full/cd729722d787e94f865749eb3098206bfe3e2209.jpg", "checksum": "57bb0bbebfd0e568f09899ac931ea35d", "status": "downloaded"}]},

One particular set of videos alleges that children in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province fell ill and were hospitalised after receiving polio drops, while a message circulating on WhatsApp has raised concerns about the safety of the oral polio vaccine (OPV). These claims have generated widespread panic and confusion among parents. To address these concerns, we conducted an investigation to verify the accuracy of these claims. Videos circulating on social media allege that children in KP's Khyber district fell ill and were hospitalised after receiving the polio vaccine. On December 9, an X (formerly Twitter) user posted two short clips supposedly showing children falling sick after taking polio drops in the Khyber district. The questioned if the quality of the vaccine was bad. The claim that the children fell ill due to the polio vaccine is . In reality, the children shown in the video became sick after taking deworming tablets on an empty stomach, not after receiving the polio drops. This was confirmed by government officials and a journalist. Attaullah Khan, the Public Relations Officer for health in KP, told that the provincial government had conducted a deworming campaign in November. The children in the video, who were from the Jamrud area of Khyber district, had taken deworming tablets without having breakfast, which led to their illness. Khan further shared a statement from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's health advisor, Ehtesham Ali, dated November 4, which clarified that several children had become ill after taking deworming tablets on an empty stomach. This was also corroborated by Bilal Ahmed Faizi, the spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, whose team was responsible for transporting the children to the hospital. Additionally, correspondent Daniyal Aziz shared a list of the eight children who had fainted, all of whom were over the age of five. This is important because polio drops are given exclusively to children under the age of five, further disproving any connection to the polio vaccine. Even the tablets shown in the video are clearly deworming tablets and not polio drops, as can be seen below. A long message circulating on WhatsApp falsely claims that the oral polio vaccine (OPV) is causing polio infections among children in Pakistan. The message urges parents to opt for the injectable polio vaccine (IPV) instead of the drops. This claim is also false. Both the oral and injectable polio vaccines are safe and effective, as confirmed by a senior health official in Pakistan. Dr Rana Muhammad Safdar, the strategic advisor for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Pakistan, explained in a written response to that both OPV and IPV play critical roles in protecting children from polio. He stated: \"Both vaccines have distinct benefits. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) provides gut immunity, preventing the virus from replicating in the human gut. The injectable vaccine (IPV) protects against paralysis. The administration of both OPV and IPV is essential for all children in Pakistan, as the country remains an endemic area for the wild poliovirus.\" The viral videos and WhatsApp messages alleging that the polio vaccine is causing harm to children are based on false information.", "images": [{"url": "https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2024-12-26/l_581683_122612_updates.jpg", "path": "full/e4ebc13587fd6bc4d71395565f4189a3c6ef46e6.jpg", "checksum": "2bfaa40aaa6555ddfcdfd92ed846ac69", "status": "downloaded"}]},

Rawal Dam, a key reservoir supplying water to Islamabad and Rawalpindi, is located within the Margalla National Park — a protected area.

The agreement further claims that the PTI “acknowledges and apologises for any prior anti-US remarks made by party leaders” and has promised to support US objectives in Pakistan by countering the growing influence of a neighbouring country. The purported contract is for three months, with the PTI agreeing to pay a retainer fee of $40,000 per month. The document was initially shared by the former caretaker information minister on X (formerly Twitter). Other social media accounts shared the same document believing it to be true. In reality, the letter is forged, confirmed both the US lobbying firm and the website of the US Department of Justice (DOJ). David Fenton, the co-director at Fenton/Arlook LLC, told via email that the document circulating online is “forged”. He pointed out spelling errors, such as “Arlock” instead of the correct spelling, “Arlook.” “Total fake,” Fenton wrote. “We have no engagement with [the] PTI USA now.” Fenton added that while his firm had worked with the PTI USA in the past, they have had no engagement with the party for several months.

This claim is incorrect. Some of the recent land allocated in Punjab is in fact fertile, documents reveal. In February last year, the Director General Strategic Projects of the Pakistan Army wrote to the Punjab Board of Revenue, requesting that the then interim Punjab government lease thousands of acres of “waste barren” state land in the province to the Green Pakistan Initiative, a collaborative effort between the Pakistan Army and the government, for its corporate farming initiative to improve food security in the country. This document was later submitted by the Punjab government to the Lahore High Court after approving the transfer of land. More recently, on August 9, Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain reiterated in the National Assembly that 4.8 million acres of “barren land” across Pakistan had been identified for lease to a company for corporate farming under the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) directive. The minister further defended the initiative, asserting that developing purported barren land would expand cultivation areas in the country. While a senior government official later confirmed to that most of this state land is located in Punjab. Recent documents contradict the government’s claim that all the land leased for the corporate farming initiative is barren. In Punjab, some of this state land is, in fact, fertile and already under cultivation. The corporate agriculture farming project is part of the Green Pakistan Initiative. Late last year, the Punjab Agricultural Department wrote to the Board of Revenue, approving the lease of 497 acres of state land in Arifwala tehsil, Pakpattan district, to a Green Pakistan Initiative company for corporate agricultural farming. While another official document dated February 20 confirmed that the public land being handed over is farmland. It stated that of the 497 acres in Arifwala, only 27 acres consist of roads and buildings. It also noted that the land will be handed over to the Green Pakistan Initiative after the Rabi crops are harvested by April 30, 2024, further showing that the land was already under cultivation. Mir Rumman Khalil, assistant commissioner of Arifwala tehsil, confirmed to that the area is cultivated with “agricultural crops,” apart from some residential sections. “There is no barren land here,” he said. Two local farmers also corroborated this, noting that the area is irrigated by water from the 3-L canal. They shared photos of their crops with Geo Fact Check as proof. As of now, farmers in Pakpattan have taken legal action, challenging the Punjab government’s decision to lease the state land for corporate farming.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility and identified the bomber as Rafiq Bizenjo. Soon after, social media users began alleging that Bizenjo was a missing person whom rights activist Dr. Mahrang Baloch had advocated for. The claim is false and the pictures being shared online are fabricated. On November 10, an X (Twitter) user criticised rights activist Dr Mahrang Baloch for raising her voice for victims of enforced disappearances in the province. “Rafiq Bizenjo, identified as the suicide bomber in the Quetta attack, had previously been reported as a missing person [by] Mahrang,” the user wrote, “However, both Mahrang and BYC [Baloch Yakjehti Committee] continue to depict him as a missing individual, using his image to fuel anti-state narratives.” Accompanying the caption were two images. One showed Dr Mahrang Bloch standing in front of a poster with images of alleged victims of enforced disappearances, amongst which was a picture of Rafiq Bizenjo, the man BLA had identified as the suicide bomber. The other picture was the one released by BLA of Rafiq Bizenjo. The post was viewed over 16,000 times and reposted nearly 100 times. Similar claims were shared on Facebook and and WhatsApp as well. Some users also that Rafiq Bizenjo was the same as Rafique Oman, who Dr Mahrang Baloch had been stating was a missing person. The claim that Dr. Mahrang Baloch advocated for the release of the suicide bomber, Rafiq Bizenjo, is false. The picture online has been altered. Also the two men - Rafiq Bizenjo and Rafique Oman - are unrelated. A reverse image search reveals that the poster circulating online in front of which rights activist Dr Mahrang Baloch is standing has an image of another man, allegedly a victim of enforced disappearance. This image has been edited and that of the suicide bomber added to make it seem as if Dr Baloch had been pushing for the release of Rafiq Bizenjo. The original image and the manipulated one can be seen below. contacted Naeema Zehri, a journalist from Khuzdar, who had taken the original picture of Dr Mahrang Baloch in front of the poster. Zehri confirmed over the phone that she took this photo of Dr. Baloch on January 13 in Islamabad. The journalist then shared nine other pictures she had snapped of Dr Mahrang Baloch and the poster behind her, which carried images of alleged missing persons. Zehri also sent screenshots of her photo gallery and specifications of the pictures to confirm that they were taken by her own camera and were not altered. The original pictures do not have the photo of the suicide bomber, Rafiq Bizenjo, on the poster behind Dr Baloch. Furthermore, social media users are confusing Rafiq Bizenjo with another man, Rafique Oman, an alleged victim of enforced disappearance from Balochistan. However, the two men are not the same. Dr Mahrang Baloch, an organizer of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), told that Rafique Oman was in fact a teacher from Kech, who had been missing for over ten years. then spoke to Samia Baloch, the daughter-in-law of Rafique Oman. She said her father-in-law was around 50 years of age, while the suicide bomber looked much younger. She added that her father-in-law has been missing since 2014 and a police complaint had also been registered for his recovery. She then shared a photo of her father-in-law which can be seen below. Additionally, contacted the government’s Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances. Farid Ahmed Khan, the secretary of the Commission, confirmed to over the phone that there is no case registered with them of a missing person whose name is Rafiq Bizenjo. also contacted two police officials from the Turbat police station, who asked not to be named. Rafique Oman’s police complaint has been registered at their police station. They further confirmed that Rafique Oman and the suicide bomber, Rafiq Bizenjo, are two different people.", "images": [{"url": "https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2024-11-16/l_574632_115915_updates.jpg", "path": "full/6e0254d290ea3ac790e4116b7473a3687238fe04.jpg", "checksum": "2f2393a35c0ffaea4f598196e6cfd658", "status": "downloaded"}]},

The claim is misleading. On September 30, during an interview with , Bilawal challenged the host of the show to name a country where judges appoint other judges. \"Give me the example of one country in the world where the appointment of judiciary is done by the judges, for the judges, and of the judges?\" he questioned. On October 8, in an interview with , Bilawal reiterated his claim: \"It is only within Pakistan where judges themselves choose judges, creating a judiciary of the judiciary, by the judiciary, and for the judiciary.\" More recently, while speaking to , Bilawal posed a question similar to the host's, asking for an example of a country where \"judges appoint a judge and where judges remove a judge.\" When the journalist mentioned India, Bilawal said the example only \"applies to the seniority principle\". \"But what is the appointment process in India? …There isn’t a single country where judges appoint a judge and judges remove a judge,\" he later said. Similarly in an interview with , he stated: \"I have not seen this anywhere in the world where judges appoint other judges.\" The statement led some social media users to believe the claim to be accurate. The claim is misleading. In India, while judges do not directly appoint judges to the higher judiciary, they have a significant influence over appointments, while the executive acts as only a nominal appointing authority. Talha Abdul Rahman, a Supreme Court lawyer in India, explained to in a written response that the judges of India’s top court are appointed by the president in consultation with the chief justice and other senior judges. \"This process is guided by the recommendations of a collegium system, consisting of the chief justice of India and the four senior-most judges of the Supreme Court,\" he stated. He explained that the collegium evaluates potential candidates based on merit, integrity, and experience. \"Some of the recommendations of the collegium are on the website of the Supreme Court of India, which are now being published to bring out greater transparency,\" Rahman said. Rahman further added that theoretically, the government can request reconsideration of a judge’s appointment and return the recommendation to the collegium. However, if the collegium reiterates the recommendation, the government is \"bound to act on the recommendation\", he said. Regarding the appointment of the chief justice of India, Rahman explained that the convention is to appoint the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court as the chief justice. \"This practice has been followed to maintain the independence and integrity of the judiciary. The outgoing chief justice often recommends their successor to the president.\" A similar collegium system is used for the appointment of high court judges in India. The chief justice of the high court and two senior-most judges forward recommendations to the Supreme Court’s collegium. \"Previously, the seniority of the high court judges was an important criteria, but the last couple of years indicate that while seniority is a relevant consideration, it is not such a serious consideration\" when appointing judges to high courts, Rahman said. He then added that in his opinion while the collegium system has its limitations, the government \"being the largest litigator in courts should not have towering influence\" on appointment of judges. The articles of India’s constitution, governing the appointment of judges can be found on the website of India’s Department of Justice . Separately, Salahuddin Ahmed, a Pakistani lawyer, explained to that while democracies have various systems for appointing judges, in neighboring India, the senior-most judges of the Supreme Court do nominate judges, with the government only issuing a formal notification. Ahmed also clarified that it was incorrect to imply that prior to the 26th Amendment, only judges appointed judges in Pakistan. Since the 18th and 19th Amendments, judicial appointments were made by a judicial commission, which included representatives from both the government and the judiciary, he explained. The names were then forwarded to a parliamentary committee comprising members from the treasury and the opposition. \"Now the balance in the [new] judicial commission has been tilted in the favor of the government,\" Ahmed said.", "images": [{"url": "https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2024-11-01/l_572082_023757_updates.jpg", "path": "full/3fa9425f01b9abecda956b6e9478205f2fd88f8d.jpg", "checksum": "865f145084227c3ee6bf1531cdc6b85c", "status": "downloaded"}]},

The demonstration took a surprising turn when their attempt to dump a truckload of manure in front of the building failed due to freezing temperatures, which solidified the waste. He's lucky it didn't break free and crush him. Normally I'd make fun of this guy but his stupidity could have gotten him killed and that's not funny. It is an epic fail though because they're losers. I saw another caption that described the dirt as manure....even funnier. Manure has moisture in it; of course it will freeze when the temps are low. We had frozen horse ball fights at the barn; those things HURT! Videos of the incident quickly went viral, showing an activist struggling to break chunks of frozen manure from the truck. Efforts included climbing atop the truck to loosen the material, but they were unsuccessful. Social media users reacted with humor, with one commenting, “I’m guessing they don’t work construction very much,” while others pointed out the obvious effect of cold weather on moisture-rich manure. Real farmers know how to use a rigid rake and pole to poke it loose. The protest stemmed from PETA’s opposition to ASPCA’s endorsement of Global Animal Partnership (GAP) certifications for factory farms. PETA alleges that labels such as “animal welfare certified” mislead consumers into believing animals are treated humanely, even when evidence of cruelty persists in GAP-certified facilities. PETA claims these labels are marketing tactics rather than true guarantees of ethical practices. ASPCA defended its stance, stating that while factory farming is cruel and needs reform, their focus is on improving welfare standards within the current system. The organization criticized PETA’s approach, emphasizing their differing strategies toward animal welfare. Law enforcement intervened during the protest, detaining the PETA activist attempting to dump the manure and the truck driver. Both are scheduled to appear in court next month.

The 26-year-old British rapper appears to delve into the aftermath of a past relationship, with many listeners drawing connections to his highly publicized TikTok drama with ex-girlfriend Madeline Argy.   From the opening lines, Cee sets a somber tone, reflecting on a former lover whose number he still knows \"by heart.\" He describes this person as being in a state of \"partyin’ and hoein’\" since their breakup, hinting at the emotional toll their separation took.   \"Broke my baby's heart, and now she's partyin’ and hoein’ / If I had a pound for every time I made her cry / Over couple years, then I could probably buy a Boeing / Paint a perfect picture of myself, it was a lie / She put my business on the net and now my true colors showin’,\" Cee raps, acknowledging his mistakes and the fallout from their relationship becoming public.   The track continues with Cee expressing remorse, admitting that he tried to buy his ex’s \"love\" but ultimately failed. He praises their maturity and self-worth while lamenting his own shortcomings, rapping, \"I’ll never learn.\" Despite his outward success, Cee reveals feeling \"sad\" and \"really numb inside,\" offering a rare glimpse into the emotional struggles behind his public persona.   The song’s release comes after a tumultuous period in Cee’s personal life. Last July, Argy took to TikTok to accuse him of infidelity, specifically alleging that he had cheated with fellow rapper Ice Spice. Argy claimed the drama was part of a larger \"marketing scheme,\" sparking widespread speculation and debate among fans.   Interestingly, Cee’s album opener, \"No Introduction,\" includes a subtle nod to Ice Spice with the line, *\"Think you’re the shit, bitch? Turn on your whip, does your engine fart?\"* This references Spice’s track \"Think U the Shit (Fart)\" from her 2024 album 'Y2K', which Jaylen Brown once called a \"worst song of all time\" contender on 'Complex’s GOAT Talk'.   As fans dissect the lyrics of \"Now We’re Strangers,\" the track has become a focal point of discussions about Cee’s personal growth and the complexities of his past relationships. With 'Can’t Rush Greatness', Central Cee not only solidifies his place in the rap scene but also opens up about the vulnerabilities behind his public image.   COMMENTS  Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

The S&P 500 dropped nearly 1.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost over 3% by the close of trading. The hardest-hit sector was semiconductor companies, with Nvidia seeing a dramatic 17% plunge in its stock price. This marked the largest single-day loss in market cap history, erasing $589 billion from Nvidia’s valuation. As a result, the chip maker lost its position as the world’s most valuable company, with Apple’s market cap rising 3% to $3.45 trillion, surpassing Nvidia’s $2.9 trillion. Other chip manufacturers, including Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, also saw sharp declines, falling 17% and 13%, respectively. The selloff was triggered by concerns over DeepSeek, a new AI application from a Chinese startup, which was said to outperform OpenAI’s ChatGPT in several benchmarks. The app surged in popularity, becoming the most downloaded app on Apple's App Store in the US on Monday, further fueling investor anxiety. Shares of Oracle, which had seen a rally last week following President Trump’s announcement of a $500 billion deal with the company to expand AI infrastructure, also fell nearly 14%. SoftBank, which was part of the deal, dropped 8% in Tokyo trading. Analysts are paying close attention to developments in China’s AI advancements. Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, cautioned that the emergence of DeepSeek might lead to a reassessment of AI spending and technology upgrades, particularly by US companies. \"Commentary from US hyperscalers this week will be key to understanding their stance on continued AI investment,\" he noted. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a modest gain of 0.65%, closing at 44,713.58, while the Nasdaq Composite ended the day 3.07% lower. Other major tech stocks in the “Magnificent Seven” also posted losses, including Microsoft, which fell 2%, and Alphabet, which lost 4%. David Bahnsen, Chief Investment Officer at The Bahnsen Group, warned that US efforts to limit China’s access to American technology, particularly chips, could lead China to become more self-sufficient and potentially the top competitor in the global tech industry.

The company's latest product, DeepSeek-R1, has been compared favorably to leading AI systems from OpenAI and Meta, achieving similar or better performance benchmarks at a fraction of the cost. This development has raised concerns among global tech firms, particularly in the United States, about increased competition in the AI sector. DeepSeek specializes in developing advanced AI language models that focus on efficient performance and affordability. Its flagship model, R1, excels in complex reasoning tasks and ranks among the top AI models globally on platforms such as Chatbot Arena. Unlike many U.S. counterparts, DeepSeek's models are open source, allowing free access, modification, and distribution. The company claims to have developed its models with significantly lower costs—reporting $5.6 million for training its latest model compared to the hundreds of millions typically required. DeepSeek's mobile app has also surged in popularity, becoming the most downloaded app in Apple's App Store across multiple countries, including the United States, U.K., and China. DeepSeek has emerged as a strong competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT by emphasizing openness and cost-effectiveness. Users can download and run the model locally, safeguarding their data from sharing or privacy breaches. The model also allows users to bypass potential censorship or biases in its outputs. Performance-wise, DeepSeek is considered superior to ChatGPT in technical tasks such as logical reasoning, coding, and mathematical calculations. However, ChatGPT continues to lead in conversational abilities, creative outputs, and handling news or current events. For general queries, both models provide comparable results. DeepSeek's rise has also unsettled   leading to a selloff in tech stocks. Major companies, including Nvidia, Broadcom, and Microsoft, experienced sharp declines in their stock prices on Monday. , saw a nearly 17% drop, erasing $589 billion from its market value—the largest single-day market cap loss in history. This downturn caused Nvidia to lose its status as the world’s most valuable company, with Apple reclaiming the top spot. Other chipmakers, including Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, also suffered significant losses of 17% and 13%, respectively. Microsoft and Alphabet experienced declines of 3.7% and 4%, while Oracle dropped nearly 14%. Analysts believe DeepSeek's emergence has raised questions about the sustainability of current AI investment levels and whether U.S. companies can maintain their technological edge. Some experts, like David Bahnsen of The Bahnsen Group, suggest that U.S. restrictions on AI chip exports to China may have driven Chinese firms to develop competitive alternatives, reducing their reliance on American technology. DeepSeek’s advancements come amid growing competition between China and the U.S. in the AI sector. While questions remain about the accuracy of DeepSeek’s claims regarding its development costs and resources, its models have proven disruptive enough to shift market dynamics and intensify competition. The situation has highlighted the increasing influence of Chinese firms in the global AI race and the challenges faced by established tech companies. Market analysts are closely monitoring whether U.S. firms will adjust their strategies in response to this emerging competition.

Liman in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit stems from allegations by Lively, 37, who accused Baldoni, 41, and several associates at Wayfarer Studios of sexual harassment and launching a smear campaign in retaliation for her speaking out about misconduct. Baldoni, in turn, has filed a $400 million countersuit against Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, and their publicist Leslie Sloane, alleging defamation and extortion. Lively’s legal team has dismissed Baldoni’s countersuit as “meritless” and “desperate,” while Baldoni’s attorney, Bryan Freedman, has called her allegations “false, outrageous, and intentionally salacious.” A pre-trial hearing to address Lively’s prospective request for a gag order, originally scheduled for February 12, has been moved up to February 3. The legal drama surrounding the film adaptation of Colleen Hoover’s It Ends With Us is drawing comparisons to other high-profile celebrity trials. Legal experts speculate the case may settle before reaching court, given that over 90% of civil cases do not proceed to trial. However, with accusations and counterclaims continuing to escalate, this high-profile legal clash is expected to remain a focal point for both fans and media outlets in the months leading up to the trial.   COMMENTS  Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

According to the Status newsletter on Monday, Acosta is likely leaving CNN after last week's announcement that his 10 a.m. ET show would be replaced by \"The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown\" as part of the network’s recent programming changes. The newsletter also revealed that CNN CEO Mark Thompson had suggested moving Acosta from his one-hour 10 a.m. ET slot to a two-hour late-night position starting at midnight, a much less prominent time slot. One CNN insider informed Fox News Digital that Acosta \"struggled with the choice\" and might be opting to end his contract earlier than expected. \"It takes courage,\" the CNN insider said. Another insider at CNN expressed disappointment about Acosta's departure, stating, \"Many viewers like Jim… if there is anyone who could make the overnight go it's him,\" and added, \"It's sad to see him go.\" CNN declined to comment on the matter. Acosta gained widespread recognition during his tenure as CNN's chief White House correspondent due to his contentious exchanges with President Donald Trump and his administration during Trump's first term. After the 2020 election, Acosta transitioned to the role of chief domestic correspondent, hosting a weekend show before eventually securing a weekday program. Although CNN's former leadership embraced Acosta's confrontations with the Trump administration, the network's current management appears to be steering the programming towards a more neutral tone in preparation for Trump's potential second term.

In the scene, Reynolds, portraying a father possessed by a malevolent force, strikes James, who appeared visibly surprised. The slap was not part of the script and was improvised to enhance the realism of the performance. In a 2005 interview with Radio Free, Reynolds described the moment as \"disturbing\" but added that James found the experience \"cool.\" He also noted that the film’s script supervisor was deeply upset by the incident. The clip, widely circulated on social media, has reignited discussions about the treatment of child actors in Hollywood. Critics have called the improvisation \"inappropriate,\" with some labeling it as \"abuse,\" while others defended Reynolds, arguing the act contributed to the intensity of the scene. This controversy comes at a sensitive time for Reynolds, whose wife, Blake Lively, is currently embroiled in a $400 million defamation lawsuit involving her It Ends With Us director, Justin Baldoni. Reynolds has not yet commented on the backlash surrounding the resurfaced clip.

Recently, the US Department of State directed all diplomatic and consular missions to suspend foreign aid programs immediately. This measure is initially for 90 days and applies to aid for countries such as Ukraine, Taiwan, Jordan, and others. According to US officials, all aid programs for Pakistan have been suspended pending a reassessment, Express News reported. As a result of this decision, several sectors have been affected. The US directive has suspended the Ambassador's Fund for Cultural Preservation projects and closed five important energy sector projects. The US State Department's instructions also affected four economic growth-related programs in Pakistan, while five agricultural development projects have had their aid stopped. Furthermore, funding for democracy, human rights, and governance-related programs has been temporarily halted, and four education and four health projects have also been suspended. Additionally, 11 governance-related projects have been impacted by this US decision. US officials stated that this decision is temporary, and after reassessing all aid programs, the future of these projects will be decided.

The order also allowed for an exemption for emergency food assistance and related expenses. In a statement on Sunday, the department defended the measures, quoting President Trump: “President Trump stated clearly that the United States is no longer going to blindly dole out money with no return for the American people.” COMMENTS  Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

The All-Star centre delivered 21 points in the opening quarter, helping the Lakers build a 23-point lead they maintained for most of the game. Davis’s 42-point performance, his third 40-point game of the season, came on 17-of-28 shooting from the field. He also pulled down eight offensive rebounds, finishing just three boards shy of his career high. LeBron James added 22 points, seven rebounds, and eight assists, while Austin Reaves contributed 17 points as the Lakers extended their winning streak to four games. The Hornets faced an early setback when LaMelo Ball, their leading scorer, exited with a left ankle sprain after backpedaling off a 3-point jumper in the second quarter. Ball, who had seven points in nine minutes, did not return. Miles Bridges led the Hornets with 26 points and eight rebounds. Josh Okogie added 19 points, while Josh Green chipped in 15. Despite cutting a 23-point deficit to single digits multiple times, Charlotte couldn’t overcome their slow start. Mark Williams, returning from injury, scored late to bring the Hornets within six points with 1:27 remaining. However, Dorian Finney-Smith responded with a driving bucket for the Lakers, and Davis sealed the game at the free-throw line after Green’s three free throws pulled Charlotte within three with 13.3 seconds left. The Lakers, beginning a four-game East Coast stretch, survived despite 19 turnovers and a poor 21.4% performance from 3-point range. Their fast start proved crucial, as they bolted to a 42-19 lead early in the second quarter before Charlotte’s rally narrowed the gap to 59-51 by halftime. Los Angeles maintained a double-digit lead for much of the second half, securing their sixth win in seven games. Charlotte, meanwhile, has now lost three of their last four outings.   COMMENTS  Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

A two-member bench, comprising Chief Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice Ejaz Anwar, heard Qaiser’s petition seeking details of cases registered against him. His counsel argued that the court had previously granted protective bail, but the order was not issued in writing. The court was requested to ensure a written order this time. During the hearing, Chief Justice Ibrahim inquired about the nature of the cases against Qaiser. Deputy Attorney General informed the court that no cases had been filed against him by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) or the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).

The court directed Islamabad police to submit a report within 15 days and clarified that it would seek a response from the city’s Inspector General, not the Commissioner. Last month, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) informed the federal capital police that 17 cases have been registered against Asad Qaiser. However, a hearing on Qaiser’s petition seeking details of these cases could not proceed as Justice Saman Raffat Imtiaz, the single bench of the IHC, left the case due to time constraints. Qaiser, represented by his lawyer Ayesha Khalid, filed the petition naming the Secretary of Interior, Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Inspector Generals of Islamabad and the four provinces, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Chairman, and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Director General as respondents.

The four-part series sheds light on the accusations of coercion, violence, and intimidation that prosecutors claim fueled his rise to power. Combs, one of the most influential figures in the music industry, denies all allegations. Through his lawyer, he labeled the series a \"one-sided and prejudicial narrative\" in a statement to Variety, expressing confidence that the judicial process will clear his name. The series features interviews with former colleagues, staff, and associates, portraying Combs as a man allegedly consumed by his own power. Journalist Mara S. Campo described him as having an \"explosive temper\" and being intolerant of opposition. Danyel Smith, former editor of Vibe, recalled receiving death threats from Combs over a 1997 cover photo disagreement, describing how staff had to help her escape from the office. Accounts of physical abuse also surface. A Howard University alumnus shared witnessing Combs beating a woman with a belt during his college years. Former bodyguard Roger Bonds and personal chef Jordan Cha'Taun detailed instances of alleged domestic violence and workplace harassment, with Cha'Taun describing stress-induced health issues during her employment. The docuseries revisits notable incidents, including the 1999 nightclub shooting where a victim alleged Combs fired a weapon. It also explores claims of sexual harassment and coercion from former employees and partners, including model Kat Pasion, who recounted being threatened with deportation after a non-consensual incident. The Fall of Diddy brings attention to the broader implications of power, abuse, and accountability in the entertainment industry, leaving viewers to grapple with the allegations against one of its most iconic figures.   COMMENTS  Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan informed the constitutional bench of the government's position during a hearing on a customs regulatory duty case. The government plans to challenge the decision, terming it unconstitutional, Express News reported. The Supreme Court’s ruling in the contempt case stated that Nazar Abbas had not willfully committed contempt of court. A two-member bench, comprising Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Aqeel Abbasi, withdrew the show-cause notice against Nazar Abbas, referring the matter to the Chief Justice of Pakistan. The bench highlighted procedural violations by the Supreme Court's Practice and Procedure Committee and the Judges’ Constitutional Committee, which had administratively reassigned cases contrary to judicial orders. The ruling stated that these committees lacked the authority to override judicial decisions. The bench recommended that the Chief Justice form a full court to address whether these committees’ actions constituted contempt of court. The court further noted that the issue is of such significance that it warrants deliberation by all Supreme Court judges collectively. This approach, the bench argued, would ensure institutional integrity and finality in the resolution of the matter. The decision follows concerns about administrative interference in judicial processes, with the court pointing out similar precedents where larger benches were formed to address issues of this magnitude.

Morales shared her account during the premiere of ID Discovery's \"The Fall of Diddy,\" a four-part docuseries delving into the \"harrowing allegations of violent behavior and illegal activity\" recently brought against Combs. According to Morales, the alleged incident occurred during the weekend of the 2010 Grammy Awards. While staying at The Beverly Hills Hotel with Ventura, Morales claimed that an enraged Combs barged into the room searching for Ventura, after which the two stepped away to argue. Morales stated that when Ventura returned from the confrontation, she appeared visibly injured, with \"knots on her head, (a) bruised eye\" and a \"busted lip.\" Morales said she contacted a doctor friend to care for Ventura, noting that neither the police nor the hospital was involved due to fear. \"We were scared off Puff. We were always scared of him,\" Morales said. \"If we called the police, what would happen? He's a very powerful person in the business, and he can do things that will make you go away. And many people are afraid of him till this day.\" When producers of \"The Fall of Diddy\" reached out for comment, representatives for Combs responded: \"Mr. Combs has full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process. In court the truth will prevail: that the accusations against Mr. Combs are pure fiction.\" Ventura's lawsuit against Combs in November 2023, which was settled within a day, opened the floodgates to multiple accusations of sexual assault and physical violence. These allegations ultimately led to Combs' arrest in September 2024 on charges of racketeering, sex trafficking, and transportation for prostitution.

The President expressed a desire to see a competitive bidding process for the app, which has about 170 million American users. Speaking to reporters, Trump confirmed Microsoft’s interest, stating, \"I would say yes,\" when asked if the tech giant was preparing to make an offer for the app. He added that several companies were significantly interested in TikTok, indicating a potential bidding war over the acquisition. This move comes after years of pressure from the US government on TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its US operations on national security grounds. Trump and his successor, Joe Biden, have raised concerns about TikTok’s data privacy and the potential for Chinese government influence. In response to questions about the bidding process, Trump remarked, “We’re going to have a lot of people bidding on it.” He also reiterated his desire to ensure China would not be involved in the app's operations in the United States, saying, \"China won’t be involved, but we’ll see what happens.\" This isn’t the first time Microsoft has shown interest in acquiring TikTok. In 2020, during Trump’s first term, ByteDance held talks with Microsoft as a potential buyer, but those discussions fell through. At the time, Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella referred to the deal as “the strangest thing I’ve ever worked on.” Despite the previous failed talks, Microsoft’s renewed interest has sparked further discussions about the future of the app. In recent developments, TikTok was briefly taken offline in the United States as Trump signed an   to delay law enforcement that would require ByteDance to either sell the app or face a ban. The 75-day delay grants TikTok some time before the ban becomes effective. In addition to Microsoft, other potential buyers have expressed interest, including billionaire   although he has yet to publicly comment on the offer. AI startup Perplexity AI also recently made a proposal to merge with TikTok, with the US government potentially taking up to half of the new company in the future. Trump’s administration had previously issued an executive order demanding ByteDance divest its US operations. Despite some setbacks, the pressure on ByteDance to sell continues, with the future of TikTok in the United States still uncertain. Trump said a decision on the app's future could come within 30 days. COMMENTS  Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

Under the r/thebachelor sub-reddit, one user commenter pointed out inconsistencies, saying, “Calling it the ‘finance field’ sounds off—it’s not something professionals say.” Others criticized the job itself, with one user stating, “Day trading isn’t a real career. It’s closer to gambling than an actual profession.” Another fan remarked, “If he were really successful, he’d be a hedge fund manager or running a family office, not just day trading.” Fans also speculated that his flashy introduction on the show, which featured a sports car, hinted at Forex trading, often associated with risky investments. Ellis isn’t the first contestant to come under scrutiny for his career. Many former Bachelor Nation stars, like Hannah Brown and Madi Prewett, entered the franchise with little to no stable income and later pivoted to successful influencer careers. One Reddit user noted, “Grant’s probably going to make $100k as the lead and turn to influencing after the show. Hopefully, he doesn’t blow it on bad trades.” Some fans expressed disappointment with the show’s casting direction. “The Bachelor used to be about the ‘dream man.’ Now we’re watching women fight over a guy whose financial stability is questionable,” one viewer commented.

Coote's refereeing career ended following a \"serious breach\" of contract. A video of him criticising Liverpool and manager Jürgen Klopp in offensive terms, alongside another video allegedly showing him using a white powder after officiating during Euro 2024, led to his dismissal. The video contains strong language. Speaking to  , Coote shared the challenges of hiding his sexuality in football’s “macho world.” He explained, “I felt a deep sense of shame during my teenage years. I didn’t come out to my parents until I was 21 or to my friends until I was 25.” Coote admitted that pressure, low self-esteem, and the fear of additional abuse as an openly gay referee contributed to his struggles. “I’ve had deeply unpleasant abuse during my career. Adding my sexuality would have made it worse. Discrimination remains an issue in football and society,” he said. He also addressed his cocaine use, calling it an escape from the relentless stress of officiating. “It’s not something I relied on regularly, but it became an outlet. It fills me with shame,” Coote admitted. PGMOL suspended Coote immediately after the video criticising Liverpool emerged, confirming his sacking last month. Coote chose not to appeal the decision. The Football Association launched its own investigation, focusing on Coote’s comments about Klopp and whether they breached misconduct rules. UEFA also appointed an ethics investigator to examine the video showing Coote allegedly using cocaine during Euro 2024. Fans reacted to the news of Coote's interview with a mixed reception. Many questioned why Coote had decided to come out with the statement only after being sacked by the PGMOL. Some users also pondered whether or not Coote was using the 'gay card' to get back into the public eye.

This change aligns with executive orders signed last week by President Donald Trump, which direct federal agencies to update official maps and communications with these new names. Photo: @NewsFromGoogle Addressing public inquiries, Google explained in a post on X: “We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.” The company clarified that users in Mexico will continue to see \"Gulf of Mexico\" displayed, while international users will see both names. Photo: @NewsFromGoogle President Trump defended the decision, emphasizing the historical significance of the name changes. He praised former President William McKinley for his economic contributions, stating that McKinley \"made the country very rich through tariffs and talent.\" The Gulf renaming, Trump added, reflects his administration’s focus on U.S. sovereignty. The mountain's name was originally changed to Denali in 2015 by President Barack Obama’s administration to honor Alaska Natives, for whom the name holds cultural and historical significance. The decision to restore \"Mount McKinley\" marks a symbolic reversal of that gesture, reigniting debates over the preservation of indigenous heritage versus historical traditions.

Woods has come forward with allegations about her time working with Sean “Diddy” Combs, claiming she was treated “like a piece of meat” during their professional relationship. In an interview with ABC News, Woods addressed her accusations against Combs, who is currently facing federal charges for sex trafficking, racketeering, and transporting individuals for prostitution. Woods, 41, described her experiences with the 55-year-old Combs as troubling, stating that his actions played a role in both the rise and fall of her career. As a member of the girl group Danity Kane, formed in 2005 on MTV’s *Making the Band*, Woods accused Combs of employing manipulative tactics, frequently shifting between criticism and praise. \"Somebody constantly treating you like a piece of meat, only seeing, only valuing you for your sex appeal. In some of the environments, it was even scary to be by yourself.\" Discussing her experiences in the Investigation Discovery docuseries *The Fall of Diddy*, Woods reflected on the degrading treatment she endured, saying, “I found myself in dark, predatory spaces, hearing some of the most demeaning comments.” She told ABC News that she often felt objectified, valued only for her physical appearance, and unsafe in many situations. Woods also claimed that Combs created a verbally abusive work environment. When asked why she chose to speak out now, she stated, “It’s less about why now and more about why I couldn’t speak earlier. I feel this is the moment where my truth will be heard, considered, and believed.” She added, “Staying silent hasn’t changed anything.” While acknowledging Combs' influence, Woods referred to him as a “community hero” she once admired, commenting, “Many don’t want to believe their hero could be someone different behind the scenes.” When asked what she would say to Combs, she replied, “I don’t know if words are necessary. Holding my head high is enough.” Combs’ legal team has denied the allegations, describing them as baseless. In a statement, they criticized the documentaries for capitalizing on a “media circus” and accused them of not allowing enough time or detail for a rebuttal. They maintained that the accusations were fabricated and expressed confidence that the judicial process would expose the truth. A source close to Combs described the allegations as disappointing and exaggerated, stating that *Making the Band* was a reality show where dramatization was often used for entertainment purposes. The source emphasized that decisions made during the show were intended to promote professionalism and ensure success. Combs is currently detained at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center while awaiting trial in May. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Danity Kane, created during *Making the Band 3*, originally consisted of Aubrey O’Day, Dawn Richard, Shannon Bex, Aundrea Fimbres, and Woods. In 2008, escalating tensions led to Combs removing both O’Day and Woods from the group. In September 2024, former member Dawn Richard filed a federal lawsuit against Combs, accusing him of a decade of sexual and verbal abuse. She also alleged that he owed her $3.5 million in unpaid wages, royalties, and tour earnings. COMMENTS  Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

Trump expressed hope for a \"bidding war\" over TikTok, adding that the app has garnered \"great interest.\" The push to sell TikTok's U.S. operations stems from longstanding national security concerns over its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Both Trump and President Joe Biden have pressed ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations, citing data security risks. In August 2020, ByteDance began exploring potential buyers, with Microsoft emerging as an early contender. These efforts have gained renewed attention recently. Trump signed an executive order last week to delay a TikTok ban imposed under the Biden administration, granting a 75-day reprieve for its 170 million U.S. users. ByteDance’s earlier negotiations with Microsoft were described by the tech giant’s former CEO as “the strangest thing.” Later, TikTok explored a partnership with Oracle, but that deal was never finalized. Other names linked to potential bids include billionaire Frank McCourt, Canadian entrepreneur Kevin O’Leary, and YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson, also known as MrBeast, who expressed interest in acquiring the app after being approached by investors. Speaking at a Republican gathering in Florida, Trump reiterated his concerns about Chinese involvement in TikTok’s U.S. operations. “If we can save all that voice and all the jobs, and China won’t be involved, we’ll see what happens,” he said. Microsoft has not commented on the ongoing discussions, stating only that it has \"nothing to share at this time.\" TikTok has also been contacted for comment. The outcome of the potential sale remains pivotal, as it could reshape the social media landscape while addressing U.S. national security concerns.   COMMENTS  Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

Known for her hit songs ‘Kill Bill’ and ‘All the Stars,’ the singer spent weeks at the foundation, engaging in the Samyama program, which she later described as a deeply transformative experience. In her Instagram posts, SZA shared that the program required complete disconnection—no phone, mirrors, or even eye contact—for over eight days. “Life is so profound and chaotic and beautiful. I have no words for my Samyama experience,” she wrote. Upon returning to her daily life, SZA expressed gratitude for the clarity and peace she gained, despite feeling initially overwhelmed. She thanked Sadhguru, the Isha volunteers, and the staff for their care, concluding her post with “Namaskaram.” Among the most emotional moments of her visit was a performance by children from Sadhguru Gurukulam Samskriti, a residential school emphasizing yoga, martial arts, music, dance, and academics. SZA shared a video of the children’s performance, describing it as “insane” and admitting it brought her to tears. “I’ve never seen such vibrant discipline,” she wrote, expressing her admiration for their talent and dedication. The performance left such an impact on SZA that she plans to incorporate the children’s audio into her music. “I’ve already sent it to my production team,” she revealed, showcasing how the experience has inspired her creatively. SZA concluded by thanking Radhe Jaggi, Sadhguru’s daughter, and the foundation’s team for an unforgettable experience. Her posts highlight the profound effect her time in India had on both her personal outlook and artistic vision, underscoring the transformative power of spiritual connection.   COMMENTS  Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

Musk's comments flew in the face of those made by Chancellor Olaf Scholz to mark 80 years since the liberation of the extermination camp in what was Nazi-occupied Poland and on the \"civilisational rupture\" of the Holocaust. \"Every single person in our country bears responsibility, regardless of their own family history, regardless of the religion or birthplace of their parents or grandparents,\" Scholz said in a speech. Musk's comments were all the more divisive as they came ahead of Monday's 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, where more than one million Jewish people and over 100,000 others died between 1940 and 1945. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose country is hosting commemorations, was quick to criticise slogans made at Saturday's rally, although he did not mention Musk by name. \"The words we heard from the main actors of the AfD rally about 'Great Germany' and 'the need to forget German guilt for Nazi crimes' sounded all too familiar and ominous,\" the Polish leader wrote on X. \"Especially only hours before the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz\". Scholz, who went to Poland for the anniversary events, responded to Tusk's message: \"I couldn't agree more, dear Donald.\" COMMENTS  Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

The collectorate audited consignments imported by M/s Sardar Enterprises during the fiscal year 2023-24, based on credible information regarding the unit's activities. The audit revealed that the company misused the exemptions granted to EPZ units, engaging in smuggling and tax evasion. In January this year, the company imported two consignments, one of which raised alarms during a detailed examination. The company had falsely declared a consignment as comprising mixed old and used LCD laptops, LCD panels, computer parts and components. However, upon inspection, the Customs audit team found used tablets and new keyboards, which are not permissible under EPZ import regulations. In the second consignment, the company declared bales of cotton in the goods declaration. However, a Customs examination revealed that 14,000 kilograms of cellulose acetate tow were concealed inside the cotton bales, which violates EPZ import laws. Through these misdeclarations, M/s Sardar Enterprises evaded Rs825 million in duties and taxes, causing a loss to the national exchequer. The collectorate has registered a case against the company's directors, Javed Rasheed and Waqar Insha, as well as clearing agent M/s Maryam Logistics' owner Ahmed Shehzad Khan and Qurban Ali. Two teams have been formed to arrest the suspects. COMMENTS  Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

During the hearing of the pleas filed by PTI founder Imran Khan as well as PTI leaders Ajmal Sabir and Sohail Irfan Abbasi in the court of Justice Amjad Ali Shah, Prosecutor Zaheer Shah argued that the trail in the case was underway with recording of the 12 witnesses, adding it is not the right time to hear the acquittal plea. He prayed the court to provide the prosecution an opportunity to get the witnesses statements recorded. The judge was convinced by the prosecution's arguments, and he dismissed all the three acquittal pleas. Earlier, the court had also dismissed the acquittal plea of Sheikh Rashid Ahmed in GHQ attack case while the high court also upheld the trial court verdict. Meanwhile, Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Aamir Farooq has summoned the Adiala Jail superintendent in a plea filed by PTI founder Imran Khan seeking facilitation for his telephonic contact with his sons, medical check-up from personal physician and provision of facilities in prison. Imran Khan's lawyer Faisal Fareed Chaudhry and the jail officials appeared before the court. The chief justice remarked that the court had solicited from the jail officials the details on phone calls and meetings. The jail officials replied that Imran Khan made a phone call to his sons on January 13. The CJ remarked that he would not have to submit a request for the phone call every now and then. The jail officials submitted that the WhatsApp calls are not allowed as per rules but Imran's contact with his sons via WhatsApp was made over the court order. They also told the court that Imran's meetings with his wife Busha Bibi were facilitated twice after his conviction. Besides, the couple also met on January 17, 20 and 23 during the trial. The IHC chief justice remarked that someone ran into during the hearing was not regarded as a meeting. The court admonished the jail officials and directed the Adiala Jail superintendent to appear before the court with detailed answers on Tuesday (today). The judge also directed the jailer to come after reading the court order of January 23. In addition, PTI founder Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi have filed appeals in IHC against their conviction in 190 million pounds reference. The petitioners requested the court to set aside the ATC verdict and order to release them on bail till the conclusion of the appeals.

The letter states that the vehicles will only be allocated to Grade 17 and 18 officers working in field offices and engaged in field operations. Officers in Grade 19 and above will not be provided vehicles under this arrangement. The vehicles will be assigned to offices rather than individuals to prevent misuse, it added. To further ensure transparency, the FBR plans to place official stickers on the vehicles to curb unauthorised use. The letter also specifies that the vehicles will be procured locally from manufacturers or their authorised agents, in compliance with the law. \"Out of approximately 260,000 manufacturers who should be paying sales tax, only 42,000 are registered with the FBR and even those that are registered are also not fully compliant\". The FBR said that sugar factories were often situated in remote areas, and hundreds of officials were deployed to monitor sugar production in locations without public transportation. It noted that the previous practice of relying on sugar mill owners for commuting arrangements had undermined the officials' integrity. Regarding the economic challenges currently facing the country, the FBR noted that foreign debt repayments have reached unprecedented levels. The letter added that sustained economic recovery depends on achieving revenue collection targets, with the FBR working on a war footing to meet the target of Rs1,300 billion in tax collections. The tax body further noted that the staff needed to be mobile and active in the field to ensure tax recovery, adding that in the previous fiscal year, the FBR faced a tax gap of Rs600 billion, including a shortfall of Rs350 billion in sales tax collections.

An eight-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin Khan commenced hearing the petitions that claim that the 26th amendment has undermined the independence of judiciary, making it subservient to the executive arm of the state. At the outset of the proceeding, lawyers of the petitioners urged the bench to form a full-court to hear the petitions. Responding to the request, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail remarked that a full court cannot be formed according to anyone's wishes. He said the nomination of judges for the CB is made by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), and all judges nominated for the CB are already part of the existing bench. \"While the JCP nominates the judges, a three-member committee comprising Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and myself list cases before the CB,\" he said. During the proceedings, Justice Mazhar also engaged with the lawyers requesting a full court. \"You seem confused about the full court. One lawyer suggests forming a full court through a judicial order, while another asks for a referral for the full court. Decide among yourselves first.\" He asked them to consider the bench as a full court. \"Only a CB can hear constitutional matters and all members of the CB are part of this bench,\" he said. Justice Mandokhail noted that the current bench effectively acts as a full court for this case. He said even if a full-court is formed, the petitioners may raise objections to it and may demand exclusion of the CB members, contending that CB is formed through the 26th amendment which is under review. Petitioner's counsel Uzair Bhandari argued that the 26th Constitutional Amendment, 2024 was passed when the house was incomplete as elections at Senate seats from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) province had not yet been held. Justice Mandokhail asked Bhandari if the 26th amendment was not passed with a two-thirds majority. \"If so, how could the house have been incomplete? Was there any objection raised about the house being incomplete or the quorum not being met?\" The counsel contended that the amendment was passed in secrecy without debate. Lawyer for another petitioner, Shahid Jameel, argued that without a clear mandate, an amendment cannot proceed. He said a number of election-related petitions are still pending before tribunals. Justice Mazhar stated that election petitions must be dealt with by election tribunals. \"According to your argument, hearings on the 26th Constitutional Amendment, 2024 should be delayed until those petitions are resolved. This would mean putting the amendment hearings on hold indefinitely.\" Counsel Sheikh Ehsanuddin argued that the 26th amendment has had profound effects. He said the amendments had allowed individuals previously disqualified to join the judiciary. The court later issued notices to all parties and adjourned the hearing for three weeks.

The spokesperson said that the author's practice of unilaterally fabricating false information without prior consent for an interview violated professional ethics and breached basic respect for the common understanding. The spokesperson said that over the past year, with joint efforts of our two countries, series of positive progress had been made. \"In March last year, we provided $100,000 in emergency cash assistance for disaster relief work in Balochistan,\" the spokesperson added. \"In May, China transported 10,000 sets of solar lighting equipment to be distributed in Balochistan. Similarly, in June, we handed over the Gwadar the China-Pakistan Friendship Hospital and the Gwadar desalination plant,\" he continued. \"In July, we organised a media delegation from Balochistan to visit China while in August, 20,000 sets of health kits were distributed to Balochistan. In October, the new Gwadar International Airport was successfully completed and in November, we organised delegations from all walks of life in Gwadar to visit China.\" He said that in December, outstanding Pakistani staff of the CPEC project, including those in Balochistan were awarded. \"The embassy will soon award Chinese Ambassador Scholarships to students in Balochistan University, Sardar Bahadur Khan University and Gwadar University,\" he added.

The bill proposed transfer of the commission's powers to the Prime Minister. Such powers include appointment of the executive director, formation of the commission and nomination of vice chancellor in the federal commission. The bill recommended maximum powers of the HEC to the Prime Minister. The President House sources told The Express Tribune that the bill in question attempted to defang the powers of the federal education commission. As per the draft of the amendment bill, available with The Express Tribune, the power of appointing the executive director of the HEC will be vested with the Prime Minister whereas the commission is autonomous as per the prevailing laws and he appoints only the HEC chairman and few members of the commission. The bill also recommends curtailing the numbers of commission's members to 10. Of which, four education experts, IT experts and scientist will be nominated by the Prime Minister. The chairmen of provincial HECs will also be the members of the commission. It is pertinent to mention that the provincial commissions are only functional in Sindh and Punjab, thus rendering K-P and Balochistan deprived of representation in the commission. Moreover, the commission will propose the names of three vice chancellors (VCs) each from public and private sector universities to the Prime Minister and he will select one each from both sectors. At present, the VCs become a part of the commission through a selection by its own committee while the chief ministers also nominate a VC in the commission.

A consultative meeting titled National Unity Against Terrorism was hosted by Gandapur at the K-P House in Islamabad on Monday. The meeting was attended by representatives from various political and religious parties, including Jamaat-e-Islami, Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen, Tehreek Minhaj-ul-Quran, Islamic Tehreek, Central Ulema Council, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, and others. Prominent leaders present at the meeting included Barrister Gohar, Asad Qaiser, Muhammad Ali Durrani, Professor Ibrahim, Liaqat Baloch, Sahibzada Abu-al-Khair Muhammad Zubair, Syed Nasir Abbas Shirazi, Allama Arif Hussain Wahidi, and Sahibzada Zahid Mehmood Qasmi, among others. Addressing the participants, Chief Minister Gandapur stated that the meeting was convened on the directive of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan with the aim to have consultation on creating a comprehensive national policy to combat terrorism, sectarianism, ethnic division, and lawlessness, ensuring the rule of law across the country. The chief minister thanked all participants, emphasising the urgent need for national unity in light of the challenges facing Pakistan. \"Due to past policy failures, the country is now grappling with terrorism, sectarianism, ethnic division, and lawlessness,\" he said\", adding that it is time to think about the kind of country we want to leave for future generations. \"If we aim to leave a better Pakistan, we must formulate and implement a robust policy against terrorism, sectarianism, and other divisive issues.\" He further highlighted the role of religious scholars in fostering unity and countering sectarianism stating that any effort against terrorism cannot succeed without public support whereas the role of religious scholars is crucial in ending sectarianism, and political and religious parties must rise above political affiliations to ensure the supremacy of law. The chief minister also praised the efforts of Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif and Muhammad Ali Durrani in bringing together such a diverse group of leaders. He expressed hope that this meeting would lay the foundation for lasting peace and national unity. He said that the proposals shared during this meeting will shape the way forward; and a committee will be formed to ensure their implementation, followed by a follow-up session to be held soon in Peshawar, with an aim to involve more stakeholders. Regarding Afghanistan, Gandapur reiterated his stance that dialogue is the only solution to resolving issues with the neighbouring country. He also revealed plans to send a delegation to Afghanistan, comprising representatives from various sectors. Participants of the meeting commended the chief minister for his initiative, describing it as a significant step toward addressing national challenges. They urged other provincial and federal governments to follow suit. Tackling terrorism, sectarianism, ethnic prejudice, and lawlessness requires a united national front, they noted. The session concluded with a joint declaration, and participants emphasissd the need for continuity in such consultations to achieve sustainable peace and national integration.

The Senate Standing Committee on Finance's subcommittee questioned how certain companies managed to conduct transactions far exceeding the legally prescribed annual limit of Rs20 million, with some firms allegedly processing transactions worth Rs2 billion to Rs5 billion in a single year. The panel was told that a total of 11 companies have been allegedly involved in the mega scandal. Presided over by Senator Mohsin Aziz, the subcommittee convened to discuss the details of the scandal. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) was heavily criticised for its failure to detect and prevent these suspicious transactions. \"How did a few companies manage transactions worth billions? Were these transactions conducted in the country of origin, the country of shipment, or elsewhere? If so, why?\" Senator Aziz questioned. He further probed how companies exceeded the Rs20 million annual transaction limits. \"Where was the FBR when these suspicious transactions occurred?\" The committee revealed that 11 companies were involved in the Rs160 billion solar panel transactions, with two central players being Star Business Solution and Moonlight from Peshawar. A private Islamic bank disclosed that the accounts for these companies were opened at its Badami Bagh branch in Lahore. Bright Star's account was opened on August 3, 2018, by Rab Nawaz and his wife, Zainab Nawaz, while Moonlight's account was initiated by Zahid Akbar. Bright Star began conducting business just three days after its account was opened. According to the bank's representatives, Bright Star processed transactions worth Rs2.7 billion in 2018, Rs5 billion in 2019, Rs1.5 billion in 2020, Rs3 billion in 2021, and Rs2.5 billion in 2022. Senator Aziz pointed out that while a single-day transaction limit was Rs2 million, these companies processed multiple millions in a single day. \"How was this possible?\" The bank officials responded that transactions exceeding Rs2 million trigger a Currency Transaction Report (CTR), which is then forwarded to the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU). FMU representatives explained that receiving a CTR does not automatically indicate suspicion, but if a transaction appears dubious, a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) is filed and forwarded to enforcement agencies for further action. Senator Aziz demanded clarity on the enforcement agencies' actions against the companies implicated in the STRs, stressing the need for stricter scrutiny and accountability. It is pertinent to note that earlier this month, the Post Clearance Audit (PCA) South uncovered a massive Rs106 billion money laundering scheme tied to fraudulent solar panel imports. The investigation identified two brothers as the alleged masterminds behind the operation, which relied on a web of seven shell companies based in Peshawar and Lahore. Despite a declared financial worth of just Rs119 million, the companies laundered billions through over-invoiced solar panel imports. PCA findings revealed that solar panel prices were inflated by up to 500%, with panels imported at $0.35$0.70 per watt, far exceeding the original $0.15 per watt cost in China. To conceal the illicit funds, Rs42 billion was deposited in cash across multiple commercial banks. COMMENTS  Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

I was never dating Tyga. I will never be dating Tyga,\" she said, emphasizing that the rapper is a friend she met during a past interview. Bobbi responds to allegations she is dating Tyga The rumors started when a clip from Tyga's livestream showed the pair talking in a games room. Fans speculated about their relationship after Althoff was seen smirking during an exchange where Tyga accused her of deleting text messages, which he claimed was behavior typical of \"cheaters.\" Althoff dismissed the claims, calling the speculation baseless. \"Sometimes the internet surprises me,\" she said. \"People have no brain cells to think this makes sense.\" Althoff also addressed the scrutiny she faces about her personal life, including criticism for keeping her two daughters off social media. \"I don’t post my kids and I’m not going to start to validate how good of a mother I am,\" she stated. This drama follows Althoff’s recent admission that she’s single after briefly dating someone following her split from ex-husband Cory Althoff in July 2023. The couple, who share two daughters, divorced in early 2024. While Althoff dismissed the Tyga rumors, fans remain divided, with some insisting their interactions were suspicious. Others defended her, stating that privacy should not equate to dishonesty. Despite the rumors, Althoff continues to focus on her podcast, where she interviews stars like Drake and Meghan Trainor, showcasing her signature deadpan style.

The prime minister said that communication and dialogue between political parties was the soul of democracy, adding that these communications helped develop a common strategy to resolve problems faced by the country and the nation. The prime minister's statement came on the heels of the PTI's decision to initially boycotting the negotiations and then linking them to the ruling alliance's announcement of establishing two separate judicial commissions to investigate May 9, 2023 and November 26, 2024 incidents. It also came at a time when the PTI leadership has already announced that it would not attend the fourth round of talks scheduled to be held on January 28 (today), if its demands were not accepted. The government has not yet accepted any of the PTI's demands, including release of political prisoners. \"Avoiding dialogue reflects an undemocratic attitude, fosters an environment of tension and harms the spirit of national unity,\" Shehbaz said in a meeting with the spokesperson of the government's negotiation committee, Senator Irfan Siddiqui, at the Prime Minister's Office. Shehbaz stressed that Pakistan required reconciliation and harmony rather than chaos, confrontation, and conflict. He underscored the importance of adopting a unified strategy to tackle critical issues, such as rebuilding the national economy and eradicating terrorism. The prime minister further stated that the country was progressing and its global stature was improving. \"No one will be allowed to hinder this journey of development and progress through undemocratic practices,\" Shehbaz said. Senator Siddiqui had called on the prime minister to brief him on the negotiations held with the PTI committee, so far. The government and the opposition have held three rounds of talks, so far, including their maiden parleys on December 23, 2024. The first two meetings could not go beyond optics, but in the third meeting, the PTI finally submitted in charter of demands to the government. The PTI negotiation committee presented the demands only after their meeting with jailed PTI founder Imran Khan in the Adiala jail. The PTI charter included two main demands formation of two judicial commissions; and \"support\" of the federal and provincial governments in bail, sentence suspensions and acquittals of \"political prisoners\" identified by the PTI. The PTI charter had stated that the demands were presented as a \"prerequisite to wider negotiations with respect to the restoration of the Constitution, the rule of law, respect for the people's mandate, and free and fair elections\". However, seven days after the third round, the PTI founder abruptly called off the dialogue, on the grounds that the government had not accepted its demands within a week's time. Siddiqui, however, had termed the unilateral decision of boycotting talks \"unfortunate\". Siddiqui had said that the PTI itself had agreed in the joint statement issued after the third meeting that the government would respond to its demands within \"seven working days.\" He had subsequently urged the PTI to review its decision. A day after announcing the end of the talks, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan deviated from his previous statement and said that Imran Khan had put the talks on hold, adding that the PTI could mull over the talks resumption only if the government constituted the judicial commissions. Despite the PTI's announcement of boycott, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq called a meeting of the negotiation committees on January 28 (today) at 11:45am at the Parliament House. Siddiqui had told media that the government's response would be presented in the meeting. For his part, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, who is the main figure in these talks, telephoned the PTI negotiation committee head Omar Ayub and invited him to in the meeting with the government side on Tuesday (today). In his conversation, the speaker emphasised that dialogue was the only viable solution to resolving all issues, emphasising the importance of finding a common ground on contentious issues through table talks and negotiations. Ayub expressed concerns over the government's use of delaying tactics in addressing the PTI's demands. He insisted that negotiations could not proceed without the formation of the judicial commissions, which remained a critical demand of the PTI. Commenting on these developments, the government committee spokesperson, Senator Siddiqui, told a private news channel that the government would also disband its negotiations committee if the PTI did not attend the next meeting. Currently, both sides are emphasising the importance of dialogue but simultaneously holding firm on their respective preconditions; resulting in a stalemate. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar repeated on Monday that they would not participate in talks and that the decision had officially been conveyed.

Interestingly, the committee responsible for listing cases before regular benches of the SC comprise CJ Yahya Afridi, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Aminuddin Khan The three-member committee responsible for listing cases before the Constitutional Bench (CB) includes Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar. The bench comprising Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi on Monday issued its written order in a contempt of court case initiated against Additional Registrar (Judicial) Nazar Abbas. The bench issued show cause notice to Abbas over alleged contempt of court after a bunch of cases in which vires of Custom Act, 1969 were challenged were withdrawn from the bench and were referred back to the CB committee for re-listing. The court noted that upon examining the case, it found that Abbas did not deliberately avoid the listing of the cases before the bench as directed in the court order. \"There is no evidence to suggest that he had any personal interest in the matter or had connived with any of the parties to the case, nor did he act with the intention of causing damage to any of the parties to the case. There is no indication of mala fide intent in his actions. \"In the absence of any such factors or elements of contumacy, his conduct cannot be considered contumacious, nor can it be said to have suffered from mala fides, requiring contempt proceedings. \"For these reasons, by accepting his explanation, the show cause notice issued against him for contempt proceedings is discharged,\" it said. The court noted that it also deliberated on the question as to whether, following the discharge of the show-cause notice against the additional registrar (judicial), the matter should be considered concluded or whether it should proceed further against the members of the two committees. The bench said the first committee led by CJ Afridi \"unlawfully\" withdrew the part-heard cases from a bench and transferred it for the consideration of the other committee, through an administrative order by undoing the effect of a judicial order. \"While the second Committee, in total disregard of the judicial order passed by the regular Bench, simply in pursuance of the direction of the first Committee, went ahead and fixed the case before the Constitutional Bench on 27 January 2025. \"Both the Committees were not legally authorized to take administrative decisions dated 17 January 2025 in violation of the judicial order,\" it added. In this background, it said, it appears that the matter has to proceed further against the members of the two committees. \"However, judicial propriety and decorum demand that the said question be considered and decided by the Full Court of the Supreme Court so that it is authoritatively decided once and for all,\" it added. The bench made it clear that it was not referring the matter to the committee constituted under Section 2 of the Practice and Procedure Act, 2023 as its authority is limited to constituting benches \"The Full Court of the Supreme Court, however, is constituted by the Constitution itself under Article 176. The distinction between the benches of a Court and the Full Court is well-established and constitutionally recognized in the provisions of Article 203J(2)© and (d) of the Constitution and the responsibility of convening the Full Court conventionally falls within the domain of the CJ.\" The division bench order also noted that no one is entitled to disobey or decline compliance with the court order merely because he believes it to be inconsistent with the Constitution and the law. \"When a Bench is seized of a case and has partly heard it, the matter becomes part of judicial proceedings, and the Bench hearing the case assumes exclusive jurisdiction over it. \"Any interferencewhether through withdrawal or reassignmentwithout judicial justification undermines the principle of judicial independence,\" it said After unveiling of the verdict, a six-member larger bench that was hearing the additional registrar's intra-court appeal against the show cause notice issued by Shah led bench disposed of the ICA. However, during the proceeding, head of the bench, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail asked as to how an order was issued when the contempt proceedings were terminated. \"The verdict [of Shah led bench] includes the chief justice among the alleged contemnors. Will those accused of contempt form the full court?\" he questioned. Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar remarked that the contempt of court law lays out a complete procedure, which includes issuance of a notice first. \"Everyone in the world is entitled to the right to a fair trial under Article 10-A. Are judges who are held as contemnor not entitled to the protections of Article 10-A?\" \"Will the full court formed include the four judges accused of contempt? They could have issued a notice, and we, the four judges, would have appeared before their court,\" He added. Later, a majority of four judges stated in the short order that the intra-court appeal was disposed of, with detailed reasons to be provided later. However, two judges, Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Shahid Waheed, agreed only to the extent of disposing of the case but disagreed with the majority of four judges on issuing detailed reasons.

The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Langrial made the statement in his defence to stop the economic transactions like buying property, car or maintaining a bank account by ineligible persons, either filers or non-filers. \"Only 12 people declared assets of more than Rs10 billion in the last year, which is a huge under declaration\", Langrial told the National Assembly Standing Committee's subcommittee on the issue of proposed restrictions on the real estate sector. The meeting was chaired by Bilal Azhar Kayani, a member of the National Assembly (MNA) belonging to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). \"Only 12 people with officially declared wealth of Rs10 billion or more does not reflect the true wealth of the Pakistanis. There are hundreds of housing societies in Pakistan and many dozens around Islamabad and Rawalpindi,\" the FBR chairman continued. India has over 100 richest persons with net worth in billions of dollars. India's 100th richest person's worth is $3.3 billion, while its richest person Mukesh Ambani's net worth is $119.5 billion, according to the Forbes. \"For the past 78 years, we have been running the country on excuses that measures to broaden the tax base can undermine the economy and it is not just the responsibility of the FBR to expand the tax base and run the system of the country,\" remarked the chairman FBR. Langrial stressed that economic activities should have a link with the personal wealth of the people. The government has proposed to disrupt economic transactions by people whose tax returns do not support such major purchases. There is also a proposal that only those persons can buy the property, whose declared assets can support such transactions. If the value of the declared asset is Rs100, the buyer can buy a property of up to Rs130 value, according to the proposal. The FBR should consider exempting the reconciliation of up to Rs50 million assets, which will allow the people to declare their assets, recommended Arif Habib. \"The draft bill is very dangerous and it leaves the buyers and the sellers of the property at the mercy of people who are ready to exploit,\" he added. Habib further said that the businesses were badly affected in recent times and the people invested only in gold and dollars. What is the need for introducing a proposal to stop purchase of properties by ineligible persons when the people have the legal obligations to file their income tax returns and the wealth statements at the end of the fiscal year, remarked Kayani, the convener of the committee. In the last fiscal year, a little fewer than 1.7 million property transactions were carried out and 93.7% transactions had a value of less than Rs10 million, said Langrial. He added that there were only 2.5% transactions that would be affected by the new legislation. \"Our objective is to target only 2.5% households,\" Langrial said. However, Ashfaq Tola, the president of the Tola Associates a tax advisory firm – warned the FBR not to disrupt the system for the sake of 41,801 or 2.5% transactions. The FBR should not bring the entire real estate sector under the clouds for these few thousands transactions, he said. Tola added that if the FBR could not handle these 41,801 people without disrupting the entire system then there was a serious question mark on the ability of the system. The FBR had shared the value-wise brief of the 1.7 million property transactions during the last year. Only 3,250 transactions having value of more than Rs50 million were declared with the property registration authorities in the last year. The actual prices are far higher than the declared values of these properties at the time of registration, said MNA Jawad Hanid Khan. The FBR should first explain the results of the powers of blocking the sim cards and disconnect the electricity and gas connections before asking for new powers, said MNA Usama Ahmed Mela. Langrial said that the taxes could not be recovered through normal means until the entire system was changed, all the officers of the FBR were honest and the civil laws were reformed. He confessed that there were thousands of people who were buying properties every year, they were filers but still did not disclose those assets in their returns. \"The decision to stop property transactions by ineligible persons would open new avenues of money laundering from Pakistan,\" warned MNA Muhammad Mobeen Arif. Langrial replied that the FBR was conscious of the fact that the housing sector had been affected and \"the FBR has a role in it\". In order to reverse the trend, He added, the government was seriously considering reducing taxes on the property transactions, subject to certain approvals. Dr Hamid Atiq Sarwar, member operations of the FBR, said that during the first half of this fiscal year, 735,000 property transactions were carried out and out of which 500,000 transactions were by the non-filers. He said that post-purchase of asset audits did not help, as the success rate was only 3%. \"The proposals are no more in the hands of the FBR and it is now up to the standing committee what kind of decision it takes, Langrial said. The sub-committee would meet again on Thursday to propose a way forward. It emerged during the discussion that the panel may recommend to the National Assembly that in case the property value was below Rs10 million, there should not be any requirement to first justify the source of buying the property.

The backlash stems from fans accusing the “Gin and Juice” hitmaker of hypocrisy due to his previous criticism of Trump. Social media users expressed disappointment, with many stating they could no longer support him. One fan wrote, “Gotta unfollow anyone that performs for Trump. Love Snoop Dogg, but this is too much.” Snoop addressed the controversy during an Instagram Live session, saying, “Y’all can’t hate enough on me. I love too much… Still a Black man, still 100 percent Black.” He also highlighted Trump’s clemency for Michael “Harry O” Harris, co-founder of Death Row Records, as a reason for his softened stance. This is not the first time entertainers have faced backlash for associating with Trump. Reality star Kim Kardashian recently lost nearly 150,000 followers after posting a photo of Melania Trump at the inauguration, and other performers, including Carrie Underwood, were also criticized for participating in related events. Despite the uproar, Snoop Dogg has maintained his position, emphasizing a desire to separate professional engagements from political affiliations. The rapper remains one of the most influential figures in the music industry, but the controversy has ignited debates about entertainers' political involvement and its impact on their fan base.

Eric Gregory, 45, a former officer with the Harrison Police Department, is accused of hiding the camera inside a home on Elm Street, according to court documents. When the camera was discovered, Gregory reportedly destroyed the SD card by cutting it up, flushing it down the toilet, and smashing the camera to conceal evidence. The Miami Township Police Department, in collaboration with the Clermont County Prosecutor's Office, filed criminal charges following a complaint involving a juvenile victim. Gregory was arrested and booked into the Clermont County Jail with bond set at $250,000. Initially placed on paid administrative leave, Gregory resigned from the Harrison Police Department shortly after the investigation began. The case is set to be presented to the Clermont County Grand Jury on Thursday, January 30. Authorities are urging anyone with additional information regarding Gregory or related offenses to contact the Miami Township Police investigative division at 513-248-3721. The incident has drawn significant public attention, emphasizing the ongoing need for accountability and stringent oversight in law enforcement. Gregory now faces severe legal consequences if found guilty of these charges. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of reporting suspicious activity and ensuring justice for victims of such invasive crimes.

Now judges from both sides have started passing judicial orders and remarks against each othersomething which was unprecedented in recent judicial history. This trend of questioning each other's conduct publicly will give more confidence to the executive to further weaken the judiciary as an institution. The superior judiciary started weakening, when chief justices began to form benches comprising \"likeminded\" judges to get favorable judicial orders in high profile cases with potential to shape national politics. Since the era of former chief justice Mian Saqib Nisar, SC judges have been divided into two camps. Divide among judges increased, when the PTI led government filed a presidential reference seeking removal of Justice Qazi Faez Isa. One section of judges was also interested in ousting him. However, they could not succeed in the end. Judicial politics intensified when Qazi Faez Isa took oath as the top judge. Two SC judgesIjaz ul Ahsan and Sayyad Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, who were originally not in Isa's rival camp, were forced to resign last year. Even a larger bench led by Aminuddin Khan held that the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) could proceed against retired judges under Article 209 of the Constitution. There is perception that the purpose of ruling was to oust Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi on account of misconduct after his resignation. After the SC ruling, the SJC declared Naqvi guilty on several charges. After the SC's reserved seats verdict of July 2024, clashes among SC judges further intensified. One section of judges in their minority view had held that the institutions are not bound to implement \"unconstitutional judicial orders\". The same section of judges led by Justice Isa facilitated the passage of the 26th Constitutional Amendment. However, the executive did not agree to extend the tenure of Isa due to several reasons. After the 26th Constitutional Amendment, like-minded judges of former CJ Isa were selected for the constitutional bench by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP). Justice Aminuddin Khan was selected as head of the constitutional bench by non-judicial members of the JCP. Now the beneficiaries of 26th Constitutional Amendment are on one side and those aggrieved by the amendment are on the other side. The constitutional bench has delayed the adjudication of the 26th Constitutional Amendment case. Now the government is likely to be successful in appointing eight more like-minded judges to the apex court through the JCP. It has already succeeded to appoint judges of its choice in the Islamabad High Court and the Sindh High Court. Lahore High Court former judge Shahid Jamil Khan said proceedings in three cases at the Supreme Court have aggravated the judicial chaos. \"The bench led by Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah has discharged the additional registrar from contempt proceedings, but has referred the matter for constitution of Full Court, to the Chief Justice of Pakistan, observing that a judicial order has been ignored by the members of two SC committees. \"In my opinion, the question regarding jurisdiction of the regular and constitutional bench should have been referred to the full court rather than the contempt case.\" He said two members of the appellate bench, constituted against the show cause notice issued to the additional registrar have already reacted to the division bench's order. \"The case has been disposed of through a split decision. Two judges of the bench have allowed the application for withdrawal of appeal whereas four judges have disposed of the contempt petition with some observations to be recorded later.\" The former LHC judge stated that the observations shall surely escalate the controversy and further polarize an already divided Supreme Court. \"In addition, the cases in which the question of jurisdiction was raised before a regular bench have been listed before the constitutional bench, in presence of the judicial order by the regular bench and particularly in presence of the direction in the judgment delivered today that case be fixed before the same bench in February. \"The constitutional bench shall hear the case tomorrow and observations or any order in the proceedings is expected to broaden the controversy. \"The only solution consistently being suggested by the lawyers appearing before all benches is that a full court be constituted for an authoritative institutional view by the Supreme Court. \"But to the utter surprise of everyone, the JCP is convened to appoint eight more judges in the Supreme Court. \"This will be taken as an attempt to outnumber judges who might opine in extension of jurisdiction to Regular Benches matters involving constitutional interpretation.\" He said the constitutional bench hearing petitions against 26th Constitutional Amendment was skeptical in recording the grounds challenging their jurisdiction being creation of the impugned amendments in the Constitution. Khan said it appeared that bothhaves and have notare fighting for judicial review powers against the legislative action, ignoring that they all are judges collectively forming the Supreme Court along with chief justice under Article 176. He said the members belonging to the executive side and dominating the JCP would be replaced with a change of regime. Khan said the divide sowed by the 26th Constitutional Amendment through Article 191A, shall continue, demolishing the separation of power and independence of judiciary as fundamental salient features of the Constitution. Abdul Moiz Jaferii Advocate said a notice of contempt was appealed against before a supposedly constitutional bench. Right at the start, the appellant's lawyer said he was no longer aggrieved as the contempt charge had been dropped against the appellant by the bench which started it. \"What followed cannot be considered judicial proceedings because there was nothing left to adjudicate. It would have been better termed a press conference if it had been live-streamed\". Jaferii said all the pretense has been dispensed with. \"But the show must go on, with the lead actors once again pretending that there is nothing to see here.\" Rida Hosain Advocate said in October last year, Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Munib Akhtar directed that the 26th amendment challenges be listed for hearing before a full court. \"This order of the committee was defied. Now, when a regular bench led by Justice Shah was examining the ouster of jurisdiction under the 26th amendment, the case was unlawfully unwithdrawn from him. \"First an administrative order of the committee was defied, and now a judicial order has been violated. \"The 26th amendment is a clear assault on judicial independence, and it is regrettable that the judiciary has not been able to unite. \"The failure of the judges to unite has allowed the executive to encroach on their domain, and has eroded the credibility of the institution. \"Ultimately, the 26th Constitutional Amendment has achieved what it was designed to do. Constitutional cases of public importance are heard by a government-approved constitutional bench. Meanwhile, judges on the regular bench struggle to preserve their jurisdiction,\" she added.

Additionally, the government will collect Rs13 billion annually on account of sales tax. These remarks were made by Universal Gas Distribution Company CEO Ghiyas Abdullah Paracha. Circular debt, which has plagued the energy sector for decades, has now crossed Rs1.6 trillion. Exploration and production (E&P) companies are owed $700 million owing to delay in payments by clients and gas curtailment. The recent decision of selling 35% gas, found by exploration firms, to a third party will help to resolve such non-payment issues. Earlier, oil and gas exploration companies were allowed to sell 10% of gas to third parties, which the current government increased to 35% in a bid to open the market and improve cash flow for energy firms. When contacted, Paracha, who is also a member of a special committee led by Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, praised the pivotal role of SIFC that facilitated critical reforms in the gas sector. \"With SIFC's consistent involvement, support and consultations with companies and stakeholders, policies and decisions are being implemented successfully,\" he said. These \"efforts will rejuvenate the energy sector and put Pakistan on the road to rapid development.\" Paracha said in case of 100 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of gas supply, companies would pay approximately $255.5 million in advance, equivalent to around Rs71.28 billion. This prepayment will prevent the accumulation of circular debt. Another key benefit is the increase in government revenue through sales tax. This policy is expected to generate roughly $46 million, or around Rs12.81 billion, in sales tax. Additionally, it will help save foreign exchange. \"If even one LNG (liquefied natural gas) cargo is not imported, the country can save about $400 million, or around Rs111 billion, in a year. This will significantly bolster the national exchequer,\" he added. Background discussions with officials of oil and gas exploration companies revealed that the government and gas firms would benefit significantly from the participation of private sector in gas marketing, distribution and sales. This collaboration will accelerate the development of Pakistan's energy sector and enhance self-reliance. They said that through the implementation of the new policy, the problem of circular debt would largely be resolved, potentially eliminating it from the gas sector. It will also have a positive impact on the cash flow of E&P companies, which will encourage further investment. Consumer gas prices are expected to fall gradually while earnings of gas companies will improve. Experts added that risks associated with new gas supplies would be reduced to zero and the unaccounted-for-gas will go further down. Moreover, they said, the government would no longer be required to subsidise any sector as the policy will attract more private companies and foreign investors. The government has laid the foundation; now the private sector must collaborate to drive the policy forward.

Energy ministry sources told The Express Tribune that the ministry floated the proposal to further reduce electricity prices for industries by Rs2.70 per unit. This would have provided nearly Rs37 billion relief to the industrial sector for the February-June period of this fiscal year. The annual impact had been estimated at Rs89 billion. The proposal was shared with the IMF last week, which has objected to it on the grounds that the government should aim at overall power sector reforms. The IMF's objection was that Pakistan should not implement this proposal in isolation. The government is working on a proposal to move from a general to a targeted subsidies regime in collaboration with the IMF. The new regime may be rolled out in July this year, which would address the issue of cross-subsidies, said the sources. \"We have decided not to follow that route and work on a comprehensive proposal to bring down power tariffs for all segments,\" said Zafar Yab Khan, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Energy. He was requested to comment on the IMF's observations about the proposal to reduce industrial tariffs by Rs2.70 per unit. It was the second such cut that the government wanted to extend to the industrial sector in the past seven months. But it again ignored the residential consumers who are also cross-subsidising the below 300 units/month consumers' bills. Earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had announced a reduction in electricity tariffs for the industrial sector by Rs10.69 per unit to boost production and exports, according to an official announcement by the Prime Minister's Office in June last year. Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar also chaired a meeting on power tariffs for industrial consumers last week, said the sources. Earlier, the IMF had also not given the go-ahead for a Rs4.80 per unit reduction in electricity prices for consumers by abolishing taxes. This would have provided Rs580 billion annual relief to residential consumers. To compensate for the Rs580 billion losses, the Power Division had proposed increasing the current Petroleum Levy rate of Rs60 per litre and sacrificing the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), according to government sources. The Power Division had proposed that income tax, sales tax, further tax, extra tax, electricity duty, and the television fee being charged on electricity bills be abolished. Many of these taxes are unjustified, but due to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR)'s failure to expand the tax base, the bills are used as a tool to collect revenues. The elimination of six types of taxes would have resulted in a Rs4.77 per unit price reduction, but it would have dented federal and provincial revenues by Rs580 billion per annum, said the sources. Out of the Rs580 billion, there was an estimated hit of Rs352 billion on the provinces. The federal government could have sustained a Rs230 billion hit, according to the sources. The per-unit electricity cost, including all taxes and surcharges, is about Rs65 to Rs70 per unit, which has already forced consumers to shift to rooftop solar panels. The plan states that by abolishing income tax and reducing the sales tax to the extent of only input tax adjustment claims of the power producers, the government can reduce the electricity price by Rs4.12 per unit. The annual impact of reducing and abolishing these taxes is Rs502 billion. Under the 7th National Finance Commission award, 57.5% of federal tax collection goes to the provinces as their shares. Then there is an extra tax carrying an annual implication of Rs64 billion. The government collects Rs62 billion in electricity duty, and its elimination would have resulted in a 51 paisa per unit reduction. There is also a Rs35 per bill PTV fee. The government collects Rs16 billion annually in PTV fees, and its elimination could have reduced electricity prices by 13 paisa per unit. There could have been a negative impact of Rs182 billion on Punjab due to the reduction in taxes, duties, and fees. Sindh would have taken an annual hit of Rs86 billion, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Rs54 billion, and Balochistan Rs28 billion.

By the close of trading, the rupee settled at 278.83, reflecting a loss of 8 paisa compared to the previous trading day. Over the past week, the rupee remained relatively stable, closing at 278.75, a slight drop from 278.71, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Market experts attribute the rupee's depreciation to three key factors: rising imports of around $5 billion per month, the SBP's dollar purchases to absorb surplus supply, and foreign loan repayments by the central bank. Internationally, the US dollar strengthened on Monday as traders evaluated the implications of US President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Although the dollar recorded its weakest performance since November 2023 last week due to diminished tariff concerns, fears resurfaced after Trump announced sweeping measures against Colombia. The tariffs and sanctions came in response to Colombia's refusal to permit US military aircraft carrying deported migrants to land, reigniting market uncertainty as the Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates steady. Meanwhile, gold prices in Pakistan continued their decline on Monday, in line with global market trends. The price of gold per tola dropped by Rs300 to Rs289,100, while the price for 10 grams fell by Rs257 to Rs247,856, according to the All-Pakistan Gems and Jewellers Sarafa Association (APGJSA). This follows a Rs200 decrease over the weekend. Globally, gold prices dropped by $3 to $2,767 per ounce on Monday, down from Friday's high of $2,785. Market analyst Adnan Agar, Director at Interactive Commodities, predicts gold will trade between $2,730 and $2,750 in the near term. Prices falling below this range could trigger a significant downward trend. However, stabilisation is more likely, with upcoming US monetary policy decisions expected to further influence gold prices.

They said the poor economic strategy of the government and the central bank dismayed the entire business community of the country. They called for a more holistic and pragmatic approach to monetary policy, one that aligns not only with the region but also with the government's broader objectives of economic growth, export enhancement, and employment generation. Expressing strong disappointment over the SBP's decision to implement a nominal reduction of just 1% in the policy interest rate, Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Muhammad Jawed Bilwani criticised the move as insufficient to address the prevailing economic challenges and unlock the country's growth potential. He said the decision reflects a lack of urgency in addressing the critical financial and economic issues faced by businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across the country. \"Despite the prime minister's assurances of bringing the interest rate down, the SBP has kept it to 12%, which the business community is unable to understand,\" he said. Bilwani added that businesses are operating under severe strain due to an unprecedented increase in input costs, including energy tariffs, fuel prices, and raw material costs, coupled with a volatile exchange rate. He said the recent decline in inflationary pressures provided ample room for the SBP to implement a more aggressive cut in interest rates. Notably, Pakistan's annual consumer price inflation rate dropped to 4.1% in December 2024, the lowest level in more than six years. This significant decrease from the multi-decade high of around 40% in May 2023 is attributed to a stable currency, lower global commodity prices, and improved supply chains. Federal B Area Association of Trade and Industry (FBATI) President Shaikh Muhammad Tahseen said the policy rate should be decreased to a single digit to entice a majority of businessmen and industrialists to borrow money from commercial banks. The SME sector needs financing of a substantial level, but commercial banks continue to support a limited section of industry tycoons to avoid penalties against lower advance-to-deposit ratio (ADR), he said. The SMEs are the backbone of the national economy; if this segment is supported, the economy will definitely flourish. He urged the government and banking regulator to devise a scheme for SMEs at affordable markup rates to revive their production and expansion on a long-term basis. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) should take a bold step in the next meeting and announce a drastic cut of 5%, he said. Speaking to The Express Tribune on Monday, SITE Association of Industry (SAI) Karachi President Ahmed Azeem Alvi said, \"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced Uraan Pakistan (programme) for better economic growth, but the bureaucracy has raised the gas tariff by 25%, and the central bank is reluctant to reduce the interest rate. If a team leader asks for something anywhere in the world, the rest of the team backs it and fulfils his commitment in letter and spirit. In this country, the PM and bureaucracy go in different directions.\" Alvi said high-interest loans are hindering economic recovery and discouraging investment, explaining that as a result, investor confidence is discouraged, and the prospects for accelerating business activities have diminished. Pakistan Chemicals & Dyes Merchants Association (PCDMA) Chairman Salim Valimuhammad has rejected the SBP's 1% reduction in the interest rate, calling it insufficient. Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) President Atif Ikram Sheikh said after deliberations across all industries and sectors, FPCCI demanded an immediate and single-stroke rate cut of 500 basis points (bps) in Monday's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting to rationalise the monetary policy and align it with the vision of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and the prime minister's vision for economic growth and exports growth. welcoming the SBP's proactive approach, the LCCI urged the government and the central bank to take additional steps to further strengthen the economy. These include addressing energy costs to reduce production expenses, introducing tax reforms to ease the financial burden on businesses and providing targeted support to SMEs. The business community also emphasised the importance of continued engagement with stakeholders to resolve structural economic challenges effectively. The LCCI leaders also called on commercial banks to extend the benefits of the reduced discount rate by lowering their lending rates for businesses, especially for SMEs and startups, which play a vital role in driving economic activity.

He demanded that the federal government reverse its decision of the unprecedented increase in gas tariff to make textile exports competitive in the international market, which had been continuously eroded by the surge in energy prices over the last two years. He said the government increased gas tariff for CPPs only while tariffs for all other sectors including fertiliser and processing firms as well as domestic consumers had been left unchanged. \"This targeted discrimination is not acceptable.\" Naveed Ahmed said the recent 16.7% increase in tariff for industries having CPPs and using gas for electricity generation to operate mills was the final nail in the coffin of the export-oriented textile industry. He called textile sector the backbone of Pakistan's exports, which was not only earning much-needed foreign exchange but was also providing employment to millions of workers directly or indirectly. Owing to an astronomical hike of 311% in gas tariff in the last two years, he said, the textile industry was becoming uncompetitive in the international market as energy costs accounted for a large share in the cost of goods production. \"With the highest energy cost in the region, highest cost of borrowing and taxes, Pakistani textiles will be uncompetitive in the international market.\" Hence, the recent increase in gas tariff would not only prove to be detrimental to the export growth target set by the prime minister in Uraan Pakistan but would also result in losing the hard-earned overseas markets. The Aptma southern zone chairman pointed out that the industry had invested billions of rupees in gas-based power generation for uninterrupted supplies for their own consumption as power distribution companies in Sindh and Balochistan did not have the capacity to provide the required load of electricity to the industry. The government was trying to encourage the use of grid electricity instead of power produced by CPPs, without realising that the policy was not implementable in Sindh and Balochistan due to poor capacity and inconsistency in supply of grid electricity, he added.

In a statement, Tanveer pointed out that Pakistan's economy was recovering after a three-year slump, during which economic activity came to a standstill and Rs32 trillion was invested in banks. He emphasised that the government must now create a favourable environment for economic growth and development. Suggesting measures for boosting growth, he called for an early decision on the independent power producers (IPPs) to ensure stable power supply, reactivation of the construction sector, which drives 72 related industries, implementation of a realistic monetary policy by reducing the rate to 9% and developing a robust fiscal policy. Tanveer commended the Special Investment Facilitation Council's (SIFC) proactive approach to promote early cotton cultivation and stressed the need for steps to locally produce edible oil. \"It will yield positive results and ease the impact on import bill.\" COMMENTS  Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

They discussed critical issues related to climate change, food security, and the protection of vulnerable populations, particularly children. The meeting underscored the importance of joint efforts between the government and international organisations to combat the impacts of climate-related disasters, including droughts and extreme weather events. As per the statement, they emphasised the severe challenges posed by climate change, which have exacerbated food insecurity in Pakistan. Alam highlighted that food security is one of the greatest challenges of the future, as increasing droughts and climate variability threaten agriculture, disrupt food production, and exacerbate water shortages across the country. To address this, she called for widespread promotion of climate-resilient agricultural practices, including planting three fruit treesavocado, orange, and bananaat every household. This initiative, she explained, would help meet food security challenges while contributing to environmental sustainability, the statement read. The meeting included a discussion of global best practices, with Alam citing African countries that have integrated crops like banana, avocado, and citrus into their economies. \"These crops are now being exported to lucrative markets in Europe and the Middle East, providing African nations with significant economic benefits,\" she said. Alam emphasised empowering young girls with climate-resilient skills. Referring to her meeting with Dr Haddy of ICESCO, she highlighted the need for green-skilled education programs for girls to prepare them for climate challenges.

The soaring price of onions, a staple in Pakistani cuisine, has placed them out of reach for many citizens. Experts pointed out that Sindh, contributing 38% to the nation's total onion production, faces significant challenges due to climatic shifts, emphasising the urgent need for sustainable farming solutions. This concern was raised during a seminar on \"Onion Breeding and Technology,\" hosted by Sindh Agriculture University (SAU) Tandojam, in collaboration with the Higher Education Commission (HEC) Islamabad. The seminar was part of an ongoing project titled \"Genetic Characterisation, Evaluation, and Selection of Onion Germplasm Entries for Resistance to Onion Thrips.\" SAU Vice Chancellor Dr Altaf Ali Siyal highlighted the adverse impact of climate change and biotic factors on onion cultivation in Sindh. He urged for advanced research, genetic breeding, and eco-friendly farming practices to counter these challenges. He also urged agricultural institutions like SAU to guide farmers in improving both yield and quality. Dr Wali Muhammad Baloch, Executive Director of Agriculture Research Sindh, cited diseases, climate-related issues, and the absence of crop rotation practices as key reasons for the decline in onion production. Dr Mehboob Ali Siyal, Director of the Nuclear Institute of Agriculture (NIA), noted that Pakistan ranks among the top 10 onion-producing nations globally. However, climatic shifts and other factors have made onions increasingly unaffordable. He expressed NIA's willingness to collaborate with SAU and other research institutions to address production challenges.

Adding to the market trouble included the uncertainty surrounding talks between the government and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), monetary policy decision by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) later in the day and concerns over the proposed Tax Laws Amendment Bill. Despite a promising start, when the KSE-100 index surged to the intra-day high of 716 points, the market reversed course, closing down by 1,360 points, or 1.18%, at 113,520.32. Weaker-than-expected earnings from Mari Petroleum, among other factors, dampened investor sentiment, contributing to the negative momentum. However, despite the downturn, there was cautious optimism among analysts that a potential rate cut could revive interest. Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corp commented that stocks turned bearish amid a slump in global equities and weak global crude oil prices. He added that uncertainty over the outcome of talks between the government and PTI, the SBP's policy rate decision to be announced later in the day and worries over the proposed Tax Laws Amendment Bill, which restricts non-filers from making stock purchases, played the role of catalysts in the bearish activity. At the close of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a decrease of 1,360.16 points, or 1.18%, and settled at 113,520.32. In its review, Topline Securities stated that the market opened on a positive note, with the index touching an impressive intra-day high of 716 points. However, the momentum was short-lived as bears swiftly took charge. The index plunged to the intra-day low of 1,398 points before closing at 113,520, marking a decline of 1,360 points, or 1.18%, it said. The negative trend could largely be attributed to weaker-than-expected financial results of Mari Petroleum, which dampened investor sentiment. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of Rs9.3, with no cash payout, which came in below market expectations and contributed significantly to the bearish activity, Topline said. The brokerage house said that Pakistan Oilfields declared 2QFY25 results, where the company posted EPS of Rs26.7, taking 1HFY25 earnings to Rs35.7 per share, along with cash dividend of Rs25 per share. JS Global analyst Muhammad Hasan Ather commented that the KSE-100 index saw a significant dip, mainly led by uncertainty about the monetary policy committee decision and a few below-expected results. Despite the downtrend, there was optimism that a substantial rate cut could positively impact market sentiment. Investors were looking forward to the results season, expecting significant dividends from some banks and fertiliser firms, Ather added. Ali Najib of Insight Securities remarked that the PSX resumed the week on a positive note, however, selling headwinds compelled the benchmark index to lose earlier gains. The main culprit behind Monday's pessimism was Mari Energy, which reported EPS of Rs9.3 for 2QFY25, significantly below street expectation of Rs12.5, with no dividend. Post-result announcement, the stock lost more than 8% and pulled the index down by 375 points, Najib observed. Later, he added, the SBP announced a reduction of 100 basis points in its policy rate that reached 12%. Overall trading volumes decreased to 494 million shares compared with Friday's tally of 632 million. Shares of 442 companies were traded. Of these, 97 stocks closed higher, 298 fell and 47 remained unchanged. Sui Southern Gas Company was the volume leader with trading in 51.65 million shares, falling Rs4.39 to close at Rs39.53. It was followed by Cnergyico PK with 50.7 million shares, falling Rs0.14 to close at Rs7.57 and WorldCall Telecom with 29.1 million shares, falling Rs0.06 to close at Rs1.73. Foreign investors bought shares worth Rs385.7 million. COMMENTS  Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.
